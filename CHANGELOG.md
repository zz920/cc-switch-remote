## [3.20.1] - 2026-08-28

This release is dominated by two Codex storylines. The first is an urgent compatibility break: Codex CLI 0.149 stopped letting custom providers inherit ambient credentials from `auth.json`, turning third-party switches made in the old default mode into 401 errors (#6744). Rather than patching around it, cc-switch now switches Codex providers config-only — the key travels in the provider's own `config.toml` table, `auth.json` returns to being purely the official ChatGPT login file — and a whole family of legacy config shapes 0.149 refuses to load is repaired on every switch, with a new preflight refusing unloadable shapes instead of reporting a "successful" switch Codex cannot start from. The second is account safety: two members of the same ChatGPT Team workspace no longer overwrite each other in the Auth Center (#6780, fixes #2245) — existing managed accounts need one re-login (see upgrade notes). Around them: provider edits now always reach the live config file (#6779), the Codex edit dialog no longer shows another provider's key (#6534), restores no longer wipe hand-written prompt files (#6810), the usage dashboard gains an auto/manual session-scan toggle plus an incremental byte-cursor scanner (a 12 MB active session file: 6.04 s → 9.3 ms) behind this release's schema migration (v17 → v18), and Otty joins the macOS terminal picker (#6620).

### Added

- **Otty Terminal Support on macOS**: "Otty" joins the macOS terminal picker for session resume, provider terminals and tool commands. Launching first attempts a new tab in the existing Otty window via the Otty CLI, then a new Otty window; provider terminals and tool commands additionally fall back to Terminal.app on failure, while a failed session resume reports the error — including an explicit install hint when the Otty CLI is missing — and copies the command to the clipboard. CLI discovery probes the app bundle (system and per-user), Homebrew paths and PATH. The user manual's macOS terminal tables were corrected along the way — Kaku and Warp were already supported but missing from the lists. (#6620)
- **OpenCode Go Subscription Usage**: The usage-script Token Plan query now recognizes OpenCode Go and shows its 5-hour / weekly / monthly usage percentages with reset times in the usage card and tray, reusing the existing quota tiers. The endpoint is Bearer-auth only (the opposite of the inference side, which only accepts `x-api-key`); a valid key without a Go subscription reports a distinct message (HTTP 403) instead of a generic auth failure, a zero-percent window drops the upstream's placeholder reset time, and an unrecognized response shape reports an error instead of an empty card. Newly added OpenCode Go providers in Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode and Pi enable the query automatically. OpenCode Zen pay-as-you-go is deliberately not covered — that plan has no usage API upstream.
- **Auto/Manual Mode for Session-Log Scanning**: The usage dashboard gains an "Auto-Scan Session Logs" card with a switch (on by default, so existing behavior is unchanged). Turning it off stops all background session-log scanning, including the startup pass, and a "Sync Now" button appears as the manual entry point, reporting imported entries, files scanned and an error count in a toast. Proxy-takeover request accounting is real-time and never reads session files, so it keeps recording either way, and the startup cost backfill (which only patches existing rows) still runs in manual mode.

### Changed

- **Codex Third-Party Switching Is Config-Only**: Switching to a third-party Codex provider now writes the API key into the provider's own `[model_providers.*]` table in `config.toml` (as `experimental_bearer_token`, honored since Codex 0.48) and never writes the key into `auth.json`, which returns to being purely the official ChatGPT login file — Codex 0.149 stopped letting custom providers inherit ambient auth from `auth.json`, which had broken third-party switches made in the default mode (key written only to `auth.json`) with a 401. The "Keep official login for direct switches" toggle now has exactly one meaning: ON leaves the ChatGPT login completely untouched across third-party switches; OFF deletes `auth.json` instead of overwriting it with the API key (a failed deletion surfaces a warning that the official login is still on disk in the Codex config directory). Two safety gates now run on every third-party switch, not just in preservation mode: a key with no provider table to hold it, and a keyless config that would fall back to the official login (`requires_openai_auth = true` without its own credentials, or a bare `openai_base_url` reroute), are both refused up front with actionable errors — including third-party cards with an empty config, which previously rode silently in `auth.json`. `requires_openai_auth` on the active keyed third-party table is stamped on each direct switch to match the preservation toggle, so Codex's login screen agrees with what is actually on disk. (#6744, #6746)
- **TeamoRouter Presets Move to teamorouter.cn**: All eight app presets now point at `api.teamorouter.cn`, with the old `.com` endpoint registered as a selectable/speed-testable fallback candidate for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex and Grok Build. Existing saved TeamoRouter providers keep whatever base URL they were saved with.

### Fixed

- **Same-Workspace ChatGPT Accounts No Longer Merge in the Auth Center**: Managed Codex OAuth accounts were keyed by `chatgpt_account_id`, which identifies a ChatGPT workspace rather than a person — two members of one Team workspace collapsed onto a single record, with the later login silently overwriting the earlier one's tokens and provider bindings pointing at whoever logged in last. Accounts are now identified locally with the OIDC subject kept as proof of user identity, so same-workspace logins coexist as separate rows. Requests routed through takeover are additionally validated against the live token of the bound account: a Codex session still holding a different member's login is refused with a "restart Codex" error instead of being forwarded under the wrong identity, and the outgoing workspace header always comes from the account binding rather than the client. Adopting a CLI-rotated refresh token and deleting `auth.json` on account removal both require provable ownership now, so cc-switch can no longer adopt or delete another workspace member's login. Every account row offers in-place re-login (bindings preserved), and cancelling or superseding a device login drops the pending flow inside cc-switch — an abandoned browser authorization can no longer be committed minutes later and silently overwrite an account. An id_token that is not a well-formed JWT yields no identity at all, so a malformed or truncated token can never stand in for a user. (#6780, #6831; fixes #2245)
- **Codex 0.149 Compatibility Repairs for Existing Configs**: A family of config shapes that made Codex 0.149 refuse to load — reported as "cc-switch says switched, Codex won't start" — are now repaired on every provider switch and takeover projection. Leftover `[model_providers.openai]` / `.ollama` / `.lmstudio` tables (written by older takeover projections; overriding a reserved id fails validation) are renamed losslessly to a cc-switch-owned id and normalized into a loadable shape; provider tables with no `name` are backfilled (0.149 rejects the whole config over any of them — Bedrock tables are deliberately left nameless because naming them breaks their built-in merge); legacy top-level `openai_base_url` reroutes carrying a usable API key are migrated into a proper custom provider table (a keyless reroute is refused by the switch-time safety gate instead); and a new preflight rejects table field combinations 0.149 cannot load, naming the offending table, instead of writing them out as a "successful" switch. Proxy takeover of a card routed at the built-in `openai` provider now uses the supported top-level knob instead of creating a reserved table, and takeover of `ollama`/`lmstudio`-routed cards fails with an explicit error. The reserved-id list now matches upstream exactly (case-sensitive; `amazon-bedrock-runtime` added, legacy `oss`/`ollama-chat` recognized as ordinary custom providers so their keys finally reach their tables), and inline `model_providers` tables receive the injected token instead of a dead top-level field.
- **A Refused Codex Switch No Longer Corrupts the Rejected Card**: Live-write validation now runs as a preflight before the current-provider pointer moves. Previously a write-layer refusal landed after `current` had already been committed, so the next switch backfilled the old live config into the refused provider's saved settings.
- **Provider Edits Always Reach the Live Config File** (#6779): A stale proxy-restore backup row — left behind by a crash or failed restore — made saves of the active provider (Claude Desktop excepted) take the takeover path, updating only the database and the backup row while the real config file silently kept the old endpoint and key, indefinitely. Ownership is now decided by a single predicate requiring actual evidence of takeover (a placeholder in the live file, or the proxy enabled and running with a backup, or an in-flight switch holding the per-app lock alongside a backup row); stale backup rows are refreshed to match the edited provider instead of hijacking the write. Universal provider saves now also re-project each generated child into the live config of any app where it is the active provider, and report per-app failures by name instead of claiming success.
- **Codex Edit Dialog No Longer Shows Another Provider's Key** (#6534; fixes #6414): With official-login preservation enabled, `auth.json` is a shared slot with no provider identity, and the edit dialog preferred it when seeding the form — so editing the active Codex provider could display, and on save persist, a key left behind by a different provider, making keys converge across cards sharing a base URL ("model not found" errors). The dialog now rebuilds the key from the provider's own bearer token in `config.toml`; official-category and OAuth-only providers are untouched, and a card whose `config.toml` carries no bearer token of its own — an older or hand-maintained shape, now that every third-party switch writes one — keeps seeding from the live `auth.json`, manual edits included, exactly as before.
- **Restores No Longer Wipe Unmanaged Prompt Files** (#6810; fixes #6778): A WebDAV/S3 download or backup import whose snapshot had no enabled prompt for an app truncated that app's live prompt file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` / `SOUL.md`) to empty — destroying hand-written local content that was never part of the sync payload. Such a restore now leaves the file untouched; disabling the last prompt from the Prompts panel still clears it as before.
- **Recovery-Screen Exit Buttons Actually Quit the App**: The `process:allow-exit` capability was missing, so on v3.20.0 the Quit button on the "database version too new" recovery screen and the exit after a config-load failure were silently rejected by the IPC layer: the Quit button did nothing (closing the window still quit the app), and after a config-load failure the app carried on into the normal UI instead of exiting as intended. This was independently discovered and fixed first by SaladDay in #6567.
- **Claude Session-Log Scanning Correctness**: Three data-accuracy fixes landed with the incremental Claude scanner. A log line caught mid-write was permanently skipped by the old line-number cursor (the unfinished tail advanced the cursor, so the completed message was never imported) — the byte cursor only commits past complete lines, so the message is picked up next round. An externally truncated or rewritten session file is never replayed: re-importing entries whose detail rows the 30-day rollup has already pruned would permanently inflate totals, so the cursor is pinned at the new end of file and the skipped range is reported in the sync errors instead of silently dropped (truncation is caught by the cursor overrunning the file; same-size rewrites by a fingerprint of the bytes before the cursor). Mid-file read errors now keep committed progress, resume from the same spot next round, and are reported instead of returning a clean success; a failed cursor prefetch aborts the round instead of behaving like a first-ever scan and double-importing history.

### Performance

- **Incremental Byte-Cursor Scanning for Claude Session Logs**: Each scan round now seeks to the last committed byte offset and reads only what was appended, instead of re-reading changed files end to end — per the change's benchmark, a 12 MB active session file drops from a 6.04 s full parse to a 9.3 ms incremental read. Per-file cursors for Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, Grok Build and Pi are prefetched with a single table read per importer each round instead of one row lookup per file, and on the Claude path each file's imports plus its cursor advance now commit in one transaction. A frozen-snapshot replay over 1,017 session files (409 MB) produced aggregates identical to the old scanner. Requires a schema migration (v17 → v18) adding two nullable columns — the byte cursor and a tail fingerprint; existing line-number cursors are converted in place on the first scan without re-importing anything.
- **Pi Session Dedup Lookups Use the Identity Indexes** (#6667): The combined dedup query (an OR across two identity columns) could only constrain the data-source prefix, scanning the entire Pi portion of the ledger for every parsed record — so Pi imports got slower as usage history grew. It is now split into indexed point lookups with identical results, so import time no longer degrades with history size.

### Internal

- **CI: WSL2 Contract Test Runs From a Prebuilt Binary** (#6472): The Windows + WSL2 job now compiles the test binary once under a native TEMP and executes it directly with TEMP pointed at the WSL UNC path, so the run step can no longer trigger a re-link where `link.exe`/`mt.exe` fail to create manifest temp files (LNK1327). The scheduled nightly full-suite workflow is deliberately unchanged until it can be validated independently.

### Upgrade notes

- **Codex OAuth accounts need one re-login**: Every managed ChatGPT (Codex OAuth) account added before this release is quarantined until you click 重新登录 / Re-login on its row in the Auth Center — older records used the ChatGPT workspace ID as the account key and carry no separately recorded per-user identity, and an ordinary token refresh cannot prove which user an old record belongs to. Provider bindings are preserved; re-login updates the account in place. Use the row's Re-login button: signing in again through "Add account" creates a second row (logins no longer merge by workspace) and leaves the old row — and any provider bound to it — still quarantined. (#6780)
- **Codex releases older than 0.48 lose third-party authentication** under config-only switching: they never read the provider-table token field. Upgrade Codex if you are on a pre-0.48 build.
- With the "Keep official login for direct switches" toggle **OFF (the default), switching to a third-party Codex provider now deletes `auth.json`** rather than overwriting it with the API key. To get the ChatGPT login back, switch to an official provider bound to an Auth Center account (its login is written back from the stored account) — a card that follows the CLI's own login needs `codex login`. Turn the toggle ON to keep the official login across third-party switches.
- **Some previously "working" Codex cards are now refused at switch time**: third-party cards with an empty config (no table to hold the key), and keyless cards relying on `requires_openai_auth = true` or a bare `openai_base_url` reroute to borrow the official login. Add a proper `[model_providers.<id>]` entry or an API key to such cards.
- **Codex configs are rewritten on the next live write** where needed for 0.149: legacy `openai_base_url` reroutes with a usable key become a `[model_providers.cc-switch]` table, stale reserved tables are renamed to a cc-switch id, missing `name` fields are filled in, and `requires_openai_auth` on the active keyed third-party table is overridden on each switch to match the preservation toggle (a hand-set value on that table does not survive a switch).
- **Database schema migrates v17 → v18** on first launch (a byte-cursor and a tail-fingerprint column on `session_log_sync`). Downgrading afterwards hits the schema-too-new guard. Usage entries the old half-line bug had already skipped are not retroactively recovered — replaying them cannot be distinguished from re-importing already-rolled-up history.
- **Truncated or externally rewritten Claude session logs are skipped, permanently and by design**: the rewritten range is not replayed (that would double-count against pruned rollups) and the skip is reported in the sync result's error list.
- **Keys already cross-contaminated before the #6534 fix are not repaired automatically**: if Codex providers sharing a base URL converged on one key, re-enter the correct key on each affected card once.
- **Restore behavior change** (#6810): restoring a snapshot in which an app has no enabled prompt now preserves that app's live prompt file — the client keeps loading its old content even though the Prompts panel shows everything disabled. Enable and then disable a prompt from the panel (or edit the file yourself) if you want it cleared.
- **Universal provider saves can now fail loudly**: if a live config file cannot be written for an app whose active provider is the generated child, the save reports an error naming the app; the database record is still saved — retry the sync or switch that app's provider once.
- **Existing TeamoRouter providers keep `api.teamorouter.com`**: re-add from the preset or edit the base URL to move to `.cn`.
- **OpenCode Go usage auto-enables only for providers added after this release**: for an existing card, open its usage-script settings and pick the Token Plan template → OpenCode Go once.

## [3.20.0] - 2026-08-18

Development since v3.19.2 spans every subsystem, led by three structural additions. Pi becomes the ninth managed app (#6064): provider management over `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with 58 presets, a prompt library with system-prompt and slash-command editors, Skills, a session browser, and — behind a schema migration (`SCHEMA_VERSION` 16 → 17, the first new table since v12 introduced profiles) — session usage imported into the dashboard (#6463). Codex gains real multi-account ChatGPT management (#3879): sign in to several accounts in the Auth Center, bind each provider card to one of them or let it follow the CLI's own login, and switch between them like any other provider — with official cards deliberately leaving auto-failover so a retry can never bill a different account. And Claude Code's built-in WebSearch now works when routed to a Responses provider or the Codex OAuth backend, alongside proxy support for Codex's standalone Alpha Search endpoint (#5681). The urgent fix is for Windows-with-WSL users: v3.19.2's switch to `ReplaceFileW` failed on `\\wsl.localhost` paths with an error the fallback did not catch, so existing configurations could not be updated or switched (#6232) — this release repairs it and adds real WSL2 filesystems to CI (#6233). The same Windows wave overhauls CLI detection to read the registry PATH and standalone installer directories, fixing a five-issue family of "not installed" and stale-version reports (#6284), eliminates the white/black startup flash (#6252), and stops the MSI from writing a garbage registry key it had been writing since v3.4.0 (#6283). Codex reasoning control gets a full pass: per-model reasoning levels in the model catalog (#6228), vendor-documented tiers pre-filled across the presets, and corrected thinking-switch dialects for the aggregator platforms that had been receiving fields their gateways never accepted. A contributor's backup/sync audit lands as two hardening waves — SQL dumps that round-trip every value and refuse truncated imports (#6146), and restores that rebuild every derived file and run strictly one at a time (#6147). Rounding it out: a sweeping provider-form consistency pass, an IME fix that stops macOS Chinese/Japanese input from corrupting form fields (#6308), and DeepSeek V4 repriced to the vendor's new peak-tier rates.

### Added

- **Pi Joins CC Switch as the Ninth Managed App**: Pi runs in additive mode like OpenCode and Hermes — a provider is enabled exactly when its key exists in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`, and multiple providers coexist. The provider form is a structured editor over Pi's native schema (API format, per-model reasoning and thinking-level maps across Pi's seven levels, compat keys), backed by 58 presets covering four of the five API formats the form offers (everything but Google Generative AI) and a reviewed 57-model capability catalog; a raw JSON editor and a fetch-models button round it out, and unknown fields in an existing node are preserved verbatim. Every read-modify-write is guarded by a content revision check, so an edit made by another process is refused with a conflict error instead of overwritten. The boundaries are deliberate and documented: CC Switch never materializes Pi's built-in providers into models.json, never reads or writes Pi's `auth.json`, and never touches `defaultProvider`/`defaultModel` — Pi's own login and model selection stay Pi's; providers already written into models.json are imported on first launch. Beyond providers: a prompt library that writes one chosen prompt into Pi's global `AGENTS.md` (auto-backing-up unmatched existing content as a library entry first), dedicated editors for `SYSTEM.md` (replaces Pi's base prompt) and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, a slash-command template manager over `~/.pi/agent/prompts/*.md`, Skills support with an exists-equals-active rule that refuses to overwrite or delete a same-named skill CC Switch does not own, a session browser for Pi's JSONL sessions, and Pi install/upgrade from Settings → About. Pi has no native MCP registry, so it is deliberately excluded from MCP sync, and it has no proxy takeover, failover or tray presence — proxy and failover commands now reject every app without a local gateway explicitly rather than writing dead configuration. (#6064)
- **Pi Session Usage in the Dashboard**: A new importer reads Pi's session files and records tokens, costs, errors and aborted turns per model under a "Pi (Session)" source with its own app filter. Pi reports its own cost per entry, and a positive reported cost is preferred; a missing or all-zero cost falls back to CC Switch's pricing table. Incremental resync fingerprints each file's tail so only appended bytes are parsed, and rewritten or branch-forked sessions are deduplicated through a new durable ledger table — `session_usage_dedup`, the reason for this release's v16 → v17 schema migration — that survives detail-row pruning and stays device-local (excluded from cloud sync, preserved on import). Because a Pi session can mix Anthropic-style and OpenAI-style APIs, sums that include Pi carry the partial cache-write caveat rather than an unqualified number. (#6463)
- **Multiple ChatGPT Accounts, Bound Per Codex Card**: The Auth Center holds any number of ChatGPT (Codex OAuth) sign-ins, and adding an OpenAI Official provider now lets you pick one of those authorized accounts right in the form — or keep the classic route: an unbound official card that follows whatever the Codex CLI is logged into, reading the local access token. Any number of official cards can coexist, and binding or unbinding keeps the card's identity, endpoints and health history (#6535 removed the earlier one-card-per-mode rule before it ever shipped). Switching to a bound card writes that account's complete token bundle into `~/.codex/auth.json` — so the bare `codex` CLI runs as that account too, and can self-refresh past the access token's lifetime — while a CLI-rotated refresh token for the same account is adopted back before each write, so re-switching never overwrites a newer login with a stale one. The account picker is a labelled dropdown with a direct jump into the Auth Center; a transient failure to load account status now shows an alert with Retry instead of reading as "not signed in", and no longer silently unbinds the account on the next save. Sign-out and account removal are serialized against provider switching, OAuth requests carry a 30-second timeout instead of ten minutes, and signing out now also cancels a device login whose network round-trip was still in flight, so an abandoned flow can no longer complete in the background and silently restore an account (#6506). Requests through takeover are validated against the bound account: a Codex session still authenticated as a different ChatGPT account fails with a "restart Codex" error instead of silently billing the wrong account. (#3879, #6535, #6506)
- **Per-Model Reasoning Levels in the Codex Model Catalog**: Each model row in the Codex provider form can now declare exactly which reasoning efforts its upstream accepts — a multi-select over the eight canonical levels (none through ultra) plus an optional default — and the generated catalog carries them to Codex's picker, instead of inheriting whatever the base template declares (none/high on the native-Responses template, gpt-5.5's low/medium/high/xhigh on the chat-conversion path). Unknown values are dropped so a typo never reaches Codex, an explicit default is validated against the declared set, and the override applies on both the neutral template path and the mirrored vendor-catalog path. The proxy transforms learned `ultra` at the same time: previously picking the deepest level on a routed provider silently disabled extended thinking (Anthropic path) or dropped the effort parameter; it now maps to the upstream's deepest legal tier. (#6228, #6181)
- **Vendor-Documented Reasoning Tiers and Real Thinking Switches Across the Codex Presets**: The presets now ship the effort tiers each vendor actually documents — Volcengine Ark low/medium/high, DouBaoSeed minimal through high, Hunyuan low/high, DeepSeek low/high/max, xAI Grok low/medium/high (no `none`: reasoning cannot be disabled), Zhipu GLM none/high, and more — so a newly added provider's Codex picker starts from the truth instead of a generic template; for Zhipu GLM this makes "disable thinking" selectable from Codex at all. Both Kimi presets enable reasoning effort per Moonshot's own integration guide, sent as top-level `reasoning_effort` with the tiers the gateway accepts, and Kimi For Coding grows from one model to the four official ones. The Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan preset gains a real thinking on/off switch using the platform's documented `thinking` object. Levels come from vendor documentation or the vendor's own Codex catalog, narrowed to the tiers that actually behave differently — MiniMax M3, MiMo and Zhipu GLM expose none/high even though their endpoints also accept lower tiers the vendors describe as equivalent; models with no evidence at all stay unfilled.
- **Claude Code Hosted WebSearch and Codex Alpha Search Through the Local Proxy**: Two web-search paths that previously dead-ended at the proxy now work. Claude Code's built-in WebSearch tool is bridged onto OpenAI Responses and the Codex OAuth backend: searches execute upstream, results come back as paired Anthropic search blocks with citations preserved and merged, and search counts land in usage. `max_uses` is enforced natively via `max_tool_calls` where the Responses API supports it, and locally with a mid-stream cutoff on Codex OAuth when the request forces the hosted tool — an unforced Codex OAuth request carrying `max_uses` fails with an explicit error, because that backend rejects `max_tool_calls` and the proxy cannot otherwise bound the budget. Constraints the Responses API cannot represent (`blocked_domains`, non-direct callers, `response_inclusion`, unknown tool versions) likewise fail with an explicit error rather than silently searching more broadly. The bridge covers the Responses conversion path only — Chat Completions upstreams still cannot serve hosted WebSearch. Separately, Codex's standalone Alpha Search endpoint is registered as a semantic passthrough with the full provider-selection, auth, model-mapping, retry and logging pipeline, ending the 404 newer Codex clients hit; full-URL providers derive the search endpoint only from unambiguous `/responses` URLs and fail closed otherwise. The Claude-in-Codex routing guide was updated in all three languages: "web search is unavailable under GPT routing" is no longer true on these paths. (#5681, #5363, #5378)
- **Baidu Qianfan Token Plan Presets**: Qianfan's Token Plan (personal) — which replaced Coding Plan for new purchases in July 2026 — gets presets for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw and Hermes on the `/tokenplan/personal` endpoints. The Codex preset carries a six-model catalog (DeepSeek V4 Pro, V4 Flash and V4 Flash 0731, GLM 5.2/5.1, Kimi K2.6) and is the first Qianfan preset with a working reasoning-effort selector alongside the thinking switch. The key must be the Token Plan subscription's dedicated key, not a general Qianfan application key; the older Coding Plan preset stays for existing subscriptions.
- **New Provider Presets: PPIO, JieKou AI, XycAi**: PPIO (vendor-contributed, later listed as a project sponsor) across six apps, defaulting to DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 on its Anthropic- and OpenAI-compatible endpoints; JieKou AI (vendor-contributed) across six apps on Claude Fable 5; XycAi (partner) across seven apps, with a fallback endpoint candidate on the four preset types that support one. (#6239, #6356)
- **Model Pickers Gained Fuzzy Search**: Every "pick a model" dropdown in the provider forms — Claude Code including Copilot, Claude Desktop mapping rows, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw and Pi — is now a searchable combobox that filters as you type and matches on vendor name as well as model id, replacing four inline copies of the same component along the way. Useful against providers that return hundreds of models. (#6285, #6353)
- **A Confirmation Animation When Routing Takeover Turns On**: Turning on takeover for the current app plays a short one-shot burst on the header brand — gated so it never fires on app launch, app switching, or when reduced motion is preferred. The same change fixes a real gap: the takeover switch is now disabled until the initial proxy status has actually loaded, so a click issued against a not-yet-known state can no longer flip takeover the wrong way. (#6209)
- **1M Context Window Toggle Restored in the Codex Form**: Upstream Codex accepts `model_context_window = 1000000` again, so the toggle (and its paired auto-compact-limit input) hidden in April is back, writing the same two config.toml fields as before.

### Changed

- **Codex Official Account Cards No Longer Take Part in Auto Failover**: An official ChatGPT card is never added to, listed in, or retried through the failover queue, and every error class on an official route is non-retryable — retrying against another provider would reuse the inbound ChatGPT authorization against a different account. Existing queue rows for the built-in official card are filtered out at read time. Official-card detection also stopped relying on the category label alone: a card whose stored config carries a real API key or an explicit third-party upstream is classed as an ordinary provider, so it keeps its direct API path and its failover eligibility. (#3879, #6535)
- **Codex OAuth Quota Display Is Now Configurable Per Card**: A card bound to a ChatGPT account gains the same "Configure usage" entry as script-based providers: the quota footer can be switched off or its refresh interval changed (previously hard-wired to five minutes with no off switch), the dialog's Test button queries the bound account rather than whatever the CLI is logged into, and the tray no longer decorates an account-bound card with the app-wide subscription percentage. (#6537)
- **OpenCode Go Connects Directly**: The OpenCode Go gateway serves native Anthropic Messages, but its `/v1/messages` only accepts `x-api-key` and silently ignores a Bearer header — so the Claude Code preset now stores the key as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and drops the Chat format declaration, connecting Claude Code straight to the gateway with no routing takeover and no "needs routing" badge. Claude Desktop keeps its proxy mode by design (it cannot rename models itself), but the proxy now passes Anthropic Messages through instead of converting to OpenAI Chat. The Codex-side preset also fills the DeepSeek V4 models' context window at 1,048,576, so Codex stops auto-compacting them around the 128K fallback. (#6171, #6196)
- **Provider Form Consistency Pass**: A contributor-led sweep aligning every app's provider dialog. Grok Build and Claude Desktop forms move onto the same glass card as the rest; sub-sections share one left-rule hierarchy; empty config editors collapse to three lines instead of reserving 6–14; Hermes and OpenClaw model editors become compact rows with expandable details and proper accessibility labels (expansion state now keyed by stable row key, so deleting a model no longer leaves the wrong rows expanded); checkboxes render through one native component instead of two visual dialects; and the Claude form's "API Format" selector is relabelled "Upstream Format" with per-option guidance on which formats require routing takeover. Separately, the partner star was removed from main-panel provider cards — partner marking now lives only in the preset picker. (#6198–#6201, #6203–#6208)
- **Claude Desktop: a Connection Mode Picker With Separate Model Lists**: Direct and Model Mapping are now chosen from a labelled dropdown instead of a switch, each mode keeps its own model rows when toggling back and forth, the direct-mode model list is always visible instead of hidden behind an "advanced" disclosure, and choosing a direct preset pre-fills its model list instead of discarding it. (#6208)
- **Grok Build Form Rebuilt on the Codex Layout**: The Grok Build provider dialog now renders the shared Codex field set — endpoint, key, default model, advanced options with upstream format, reasoning and User-Agent — with Grok-specific wording throughout (a follow-up caught five Codex-worded hints the alignment had leaked in). The standalone "API Backend" and "client model profile" inputs are gone: the client always speaks Responses — to the local proxy when a Chat or Anthropic upstream needs converting, straight to the upstream otherwise — and the upstream protocol is expressed through Advanced → Upstream Format; saving through the form pins `api_backend = "responses"` in the stored config, applied to the live file immediately for the current provider and on the next switch for others — see Upgrade notes. (#6427, #6511)
- **Kimi Upstreams Get Clean Passthrough**: At Moonshot's request, the proxy no longer injects placeholder thinking blocks into tool-call history or emits the non-standard `reasoning_content` field for Kimi/Moonshot endpoints — their gateways no longer require thinking replay, and the injected placeholders were disrupting the model's chain of thought. Tool-call history is forwarded as-is on Kimi routes (the rest of the proxy pipeline is unchanged), effective immediately for existing providers. DeepSeek and MiMo keep the behavior; theirs is a documented server-side requirement.
- **BytePlus Preset Switched to Native Responses**: BytePlus' own Codex guide configures `wire_api = "responses"` on the exact endpoint the preset uses, so it now declares native Responses like its domestic Volcengine siblings instead of routing through the Chat conversion layer, and pre-fills the documented low/medium/high tiers.
- **Goal Mode Toggle Removed From the Codex Form**: codex-cli 0.147.0 enables goals by default, which had turned the toggle actively misleading — unchecking it removed the config line, which now falls back to on, so the box read unchecked while the feature stayed enabled. Nothing needs configuring anymore; a `goals = true` you previously wrote stays in config.toml with no effect.
- **DeepSeek V4 Repriced to the New Peak-Tier Rates, Gemini 3.7 Flash Seeded**: DeepSeek introduced peak/off-peak billing on 2026-08-16 with a steep rise: the built-in rates for `deepseek-v4-flash` (and its `-0731`, `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner` aliases) move from $0.14/$0.28 to $0.44/$1.32 per million input/output with $0.014 cache read, and `deepseek-v4-pro` from $0.435/$0.87 to $1.32/$3.96 with $0.044 cache read. The pricing table has no time-of-day dimension, so the peak tier was recorded deliberately — peak hours (Beijing 09:00–12:00, 14:00–18:00) coincide with working hours; usage in the other seventeen hours of the day therefore reads about twice its billed cost. Guarded repairs migrate databases still holding the old built-in values; a price you edited yourself is never touched, and models.dev could not have caught this change — it still carried the old rates, so these came from the vendor's own price page. `gemini-3.7-flash` is seeded at its introductory $0.75/$3.75 with $0.075 cache read (list price applies from 2027); `gemini-3.6-flash` is unchanged — it did not get the promotional rate.
- **Project Profile Changes Now Trigger Auto-Sync**: The WebDAV/S3 auto-sync trigger list had never been updated for the `profiles` table, so profile edits only reached the cloud when some other table happened to change; the two per-transport copies of that list are now one shared list that includes profiles. (#6147)
- **Partner Roster Maintenance**: RunAPI's presets move to its new `runapi.host` domain, keeping the old domain as a fallback endpoint candidate where the preset type supports one; PPIO is listed as a project sponsor; the FennoAI promotion line reflects its current offer.

### Fixed

- **Windows: Config Updates on WSL Paths Failed on v3.19.2**: v3.19.2 switched Windows atomic writes to `ReplaceFileW`, which the WSL filesystem rejects with `ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` (50) — but the rename fallback only engaged on NotFound, so any write replacing an existing live config on a `\\wsl.localhost` / `\\wsl$` path failed outright: existing providers could not be updated or switched (only the first-ever write of a config file, where the missing target already triggered the fallback, still worked). Error 50 now falls through to the rename path WSL accepts. Only v3.19.2 is affected; there is no in-app workaround on that version, so affected users should upgrade directly. (#6232, #6224, #6219, #6188, #6247)
- **Windows: CLI Detection Now Sees What Your Terminal Sees**: Version detection relied on the inherited process PATH plus a hardcoded directory list — probed in the wrong order. Three visible failure modes, one cause each: after an in-app self-update, the relaunched process inherits only the machine PATH and loses the user PATH, so user-installed CLIs read "not installed" until a full relaunch from the Start menu (#6061); winget's Claude Code, the standalone Codex installer and custom npm prefixes lived in directories never scanned (#6278, #6047, #4366); and hardcoded directories were probed before the PATH default, letting a stale `%APPDATA%\npm` shim mask the newer install actually on PATH — "updated but still shows the old version" (#4701). Detection now merges the registry PATH (user and machine, with `%VAR%` expansion) into the effective search path, scans the standalone installer directories, probes the PATH default first via an explicit `where.exe` invocation that skips Microsoft Store app aliases and never searches the current directory, and feeds the same merged PATH to install-conflict diagnosis and anchored upgrades. (#6284)
- **No More White/Black Flash at Startup**: The window was shown before the theme class was applied, so an unthemed page painted first. An inline pre-paint script now applies the persisted theme synchronously before the bundle loads on every platform, and on Windows the window additionally stays hidden until the page has finished loading. (#6252, #6182)
- **Windows Installer No Longer Writes a Garbage Registry Key**: The WiX template's `Software\{{manufacturer}}\{{product_name}}` used single backslashes, which Handlebars consumed as its escape sequence — so every MSI since v3.4.0 created a literal `HKCU\Software{{manufacturer}}{{product_name}}` key instead of the intended path. Both backslashes are doubled, matching every other key in the template. The stale key on already-installed machines is not cleaned up — see Upgrade notes. (#6283)
- **Proxy Takeover Restore No Longer Wipes the Official ChatGPT Login**: The takeover restore backup is a snapshot from when takeover started; if you ran `codex login` while takeover was active, every restore — stopping takeover, quitting the app, crash recovery — overwrote the fresh login with the pre-login snapshot, and automatic re-takeover on startup made the wipe repeat every restart. Restore now arbitrates: live login material always wins (only Codex itself can advance it, so it is always newer than the snapshot), and the backed-up third-party API key is preserved by demoting it into config.toml instead of clobbering auth.json. A login already destroyed by an earlier release is not restored — run `codex login` once. (#6277)
- **Environment Check No Longer Hangs on "Update All" or Conflict Diagnosis**: A refactor that shipped in v3.19.2 spawned the PATH-probe login shell into a background process group that still held the controlling terminal, so on an instance started from a terminal, job control stopped the shell with SIGTTIN and the untimed wait never returned — freezing the whole preflight. Even where that could not happen (a normally launched build has no controlling terminal), the path carried no deadline at all, Windows included, so one hung probe — a blocking `.zshrc`, a `--version` that never exits — froze the run just the same. Probes now run in a fully detached session with stdin nulled and a 10-second deadline that kills the whole process tree; a lost probe degrades that one tool's report instead of hanging the run, and the buttons show a spinner during the probe phase instead of appearing to ignore the click. (regression from #5522)
- **macOS IME Input No Longer Corrupts Provider Form Fields**: With a Chinese/Japanese input method, fast typing into provider form fields intermittently duplicated and reordered characters — in the reported reproduction, a 12-character value ballooned to 1,396 characters. Controlled inputs were writing parent state back into the DOM while the IME still owned the composition range, and the provider-key fields even ran their lowercase-and-strip normalization on every intermediate composition state. A shared IME-safe input now keeps composition text local until it commits, applies normalization only to the finished text, and force-commits pending text when focus leaves mid-composition (a WebKit window-switch path that never delivers `compositionend`). Applied to the shared name/notes/website fields of every app and the Hermes, OpenClaw and OpenCode field sets, where the corruption was reported. Values already saved corrupted stay corrupted — re-edit them once. (#6308, #6333, #6507)
- **Thinking-Switch Dialects Corrected for ModelScope, Novita and Nvidia**: All three aggregator presets declared the Zhipu-style `thinking:{type}` object none of these platforms documents: on ModelScope and Novita the toggle did nothing, and on Nvidia NIM the injected field could be rejected outright, since its per-model OpenAPI forbids unknown top-level fields. ModelScope and Novita now send the `enable_thinking` boolean their platforms document; Nvidia's switch is withdrawn entirely, because the real control is out of the parameter's reach. The platform inference table gained a ModelScope branch, so hand-created ModelScope providers with no stored declaration are corrected immediately; providers created from the old presets keep the wrong dialect until the preset is re-added.
- **StepFun Reasoning Effort Reaches step-3.7-flash**: The StepFun inference branch only granted effort to the 2603-suffixed models, so the effort selected in Codex was silently dropped for step-3.7-flash; it now passes through verbatim (low/medium/high), while the 2603 models keep their two-tier mapping and the suffix-less step-3.5-flash deliberately gets no effort field at all — StepFun documents no effort control for it, and no way to disable thinking anywhere in the family.
- **SiliconFlow and ModelScope Presets Pointed at Models That Do Not Exist**: A vendor-catalog audit found the SiliconFlow presets shipping a MiniMax id absent from both sites — the first request failed with 400 "Model does not exist" — and the ModelScope preset pointing at a GLM id unavailable on its free route. The presets now ship `Pro/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` (.cn), `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` (.com, with its real 1M window) and `ZhipuAI/GLM-5.2`, across all seven apps that carry these providers. One known leftover: OpenClaw's copies still carry the previous model's cost figures, pending a separate re-audit.
- **OpenCode Zen Reasoning Effort Reaches the Gateway**: With the OpenCode Go preset in routing mode, the reasoning level chosen in Codex never reached the gateway as chosen: on the GLM/Kimi/MiMo models the proxy fell back to model-vendor heuristics, dropped the level and sent a Zhipu-shaped field the gateway ignores, and on the DeepSeek models it sent the DeepSeek dialect's coerced value instead of the picked one. A platform rule for `opencode.ai` now sends top-level `reasoning_effort`, clamped per model to the tiers that model declares (via the per-model reasoning levels above), and sends nothing for models with no effort control rather than guessing. Existing providers need the preset re-added once to carry the per-model tier table — until then no effort field is sent at all. (#6123, #6112)
- **DeepSeek Cache-Hit Tokens Counted on the Chat Path**: Relays that forward only DeepSeek's documented `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` — without mirroring it into the OpenAI-style field — had their cache hits recorded as zero, overstating cost by pricing hit tokens as fresh input. The field now sits at the end of the standard fallback chain, on both the usage parser and the synthesized Codex usage. (#6126, #6073)
- **Grok Build Conversations No Longer Fail on a Missing Usage Field**: A Grok Build provider on a Chat Completions upstream failed with "missing field `input_tokens_details`" on every turn the upstream reported no cache tokens — with the reported GLM-5.2 upstream, which always sends `cached_tokens: 0`, that was every turn. The Chat→Responses usage translator only emitted that object when cache tokens were present, and the Grok client requires it; it is now always emitted, on the streaming path too. (#6423, #6140)
- **Usage Trend Tooltip and Highlight Agree Across Years**: On a range spanning multiple years, hovering highlighted a point from one year while the tooltip described another: the chart keyed its X axis on the localized MM/DD label, so buckets from different years shared one category value and the chart library's active-point lookup returned the first match — the highlight snapped to the earlier year's point while the tooltip followed the cursor (the plotted points themselves were always in the right place). The axis now keys on the backend's full bucket timestamp, with tick labels and tooltips resolved separately (and a year shown when the range crosses one). (#6337, #6302)
- **Zhipu Quota Tiers Reappear After the CREDIT_LIMIT Rename**: Zhipu renamed the quota entry type on the mainland endpoint from `TOKENS_LIMIT` to `CREDIT_LIMIT`; the parser filtered on the old value alone and dropped every tier, leaving the panel empty. Both values are accepted now. (#6160, #6153)
- **Grok 4.5 Cached Rate Corrected; Grok 4.6 and a DeepSeek Alias Priced**: `grok-4.5` had been seeded with grok-4.6's $0.50 cached-input rate; it is corrected to the actual $0.30, with a guarded repair for existing databases. `grok-4.6` is seeded at $2/$6 with $0.50 cache read — the base tier: xAI doubles every Grok 4.5/4.6 rate above a 200K prompt and the table has no tier column, so long-context Grok requests read at about half their billed cost. And `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` — a 4-digit date variant the id normalizer cannot strip, so it matched no pricing row and billed at $0 — gets its own row; previously-zero rows for it are backfilled at the current rate, so historical totals for that model rise.
- **SQL Backups Round-Trip Every Value, and Truncated Imports Are Rejected**: Four defects in the SQL dump/import cycle: TEXT values with non-UTF-8 bytes aborted the export while a NUL byte silently truncated the statement; REAL values lost their storage class (infinities, negative zero, integral REALs); AUTOINCREMENT high-water marks were re-derived from surviving rows instead of preserved; and a restore left the database's `auto_vacuum` mode downgraded, which the next launch repaired with a full VACUUM rebuild. All four are fixed. Validation also moved before table creation: a truncated SQL file — or one missing CC Switch's core tables — is now rejected with the live database untouched, where before schema migration could fabricate the missing tables and let partial data replace your database. A genuine export with no providers or MCP servers now imports instead of being refused. (#6146)
- **Backup Files Are Published Atomically and Never Deleted Out From Under a Restore**: A backup used to be created at its final name before any page was copied, with the copy result ignored — an interrupted copy became an apparently valid backup file. Backups are now built in a temp file, integrity-checked, and only then published without clobbering. Restores validate the whole image — integrity, schema tables, migrations — in a staging database before the live database is touched, so a corrupt or newer-schema backup fails cleanly instead of being discovered mid-replacement; and retention now protects both the backup being restored and the fresh safety snapshot, which a small retain-count setting could previously delete at exactly the wrong moment. (#6146)
- **Restoring a Backup Now Rebuilds What Depends on the Database**: Restoring a `.db` backup changed only the database — every app's live config file kept its pre-restore content until the next manual provider switch, and the post-import routine after SQL imports and cloud downloads ran against a throwaway state object whose cache invalidations reached nothing. All restore paths now project the restored database outward — the live configs of every managed app except Pi (whose `models.json` stays the source of truth and is re-imported on next launch), per-app prompt files, the runtime log level, and the tray's usage cache — and re-apply your local settings file and user-owned model-pricing overrides on top of the restored rows; one app failing no longer silently skips the rest. (#6147, #6129)
- **Sync, Restore and Skills Operations Run Strictly One at a Time**: WebDAV and S3 each held their own lock, so two transports could restore concurrently; the post-download projection ran outside any lock; manual imports and `.db` restores took no lock at all; and the Skills files shared no lock with the database rows they mirror, so a snapshot could capture the two mid-change. One global sync lock now serializes every path end-to-end, a Skills state lock keeps rows and files moving together, and auto-sync suppression starts only when a download actually begins rather than while it waits in queue — so local edits made during the wait are no longer silently swallowed. Session-log read cursors are also excluded from cloud snapshots now: they are absolute local file positions, and importing another machine's cursors desynced local usage ingestion. (#6147, #6129)
- **A Skill Whose Files Are Missing Shows as Updatable**: Update checks trusted the database-cached content hash without ever looking at the filesystem, so a skill whose files were gone — typically after a cross-machine database restore, which moves rows but not files — permanently reported "no update", and the only recovery was uninstall-reinstall. The check now verifies the skill's directory exists before trusting the cache; a missing directory surfaces as an available update whose install rebuilds the files. This covers repo-installed skills — locally created skills are not update-checked at all, so missing files there still need a manual re-add.
- **OpenClaw "Set as Default" Asks Which Model and Preserves Your Fallbacks**: Setting a provider as default always picked its first model and replaced whatever fallback chain `openclaw.json` contained with a synthetic one. Multi-model providers now get a picker, and the write merges into the existing default-model block, preserving fallbacks and unknown keys. (#6201)
- **A User-Owned Codex `model_catalog_json` Is No Longer Overwritten**: Switching providers unconditionally repointed `model_catalog_json` in `~/.codex/config.toml` at the app-generated catalog, discarding a custom catalog path. The pointer is now claimed only when absent or already CC Switch's own filename. Prevention only: a pointer already rewritten by an earlier version is not restored — see Upgrade notes. (#6087)
- **Restored Angle-Bracket Text in the Mirrored DeepSeek Codex Catalog**: The bundled mirror of DeepSeek's official Codex catalog had been extracted with HTML unescaping applied before tag stripping, so literal angle-bracket text inside four harness strings was swallowed as markup — mangling an instruction sentence and a markdown-link example in `base_instructions` and the message template of both models. The mirror is byte-faithful again, and existing DeepSeek native-Responses providers pick it up on their next switch with no re-save.
- **Volcengine Ark: the Agent Plan Preset Now Actually Targets Agent Plan**: The preset named for Agent Plan pointed at Coding Plan where it mattered — the endpoints and the invite link — and the two plans are separate subscriptions that do not share quota. It is split into two presets across six apps: Agent Plan on `/api/plan[/v3]` (native Responses on Codex) and Coding Plan on the old `/api/coding[/v3]`. Plan-quota detection is widened to recognize the Agent Plan endpoints, which takes effect immediately for stored providers; the presets themselves apply to newly created ones — an Agent Plan subscriber with an old provider should re-create it or edit the base URL. (#6070, #6448)

### Security

- **Model-Fetch Errors No Longer Echo Credentials**: A failed "fetch models" call could reflect the API key back into the visible error message, and masking elsewhere only engaged on secrets of eight or more characters. Fetch error bodies now pass through strict redaction that hides the key — and the custom header values this release newly lets you send — down to one character, for every app's provider form. The fetch itself also became format-aware for Pi: the credential header follows the provider's API format, and validated custom headers are supported, including header-only authentication. (#6064)

### Internal

- **CI Runs Only the Checks a Pull Request Affects**: A path-filter job classifies PRs into frontend/backend and skips the other side's jobs; docs-only PRs skip both. Pushes to main still run everything to keep shared caches warm, and any workflow edit runs the full matrix. The i18n labeler glob was also pointed at the real locales path, so the label fires for the first time.
- **Windows Backend Tests Run Against a Real WSL2 Filesystem**: The class of bug behind the v3.19.2 WSL write regression had no coverage — CI never touched a `\\wsl.localhost` path. Every PR that touches backend code now runs an atomic-write contract test against a real WSL2 distro on the Windows runner, and a nightly workflow runs the full backend suite against a WSL2-backed home (it takes 50+ minutes on the 9P filesystem, too slow per-PR). (#6233)

### Upgrade notes

- This release migrates the database schema from v16 to v17 (a new session-usage dedup ledger for the Pi importer); a pre-migration backup is created automatically. After running this version once, older CC Switch builds refuse to open the database — downgrading requires restoring that backup.
- Pi appears as a new app tab by default. On first launch, providers already written in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` are imported as manageable cards; the first usage sync scans all discoverable Pi sessions and backfills historical usage, so dashboard totals can jump. Pi's own login, default provider and default model are never touched. A Pi `sessionDir` configured as a relative path cannot be enumerated — set an absolute one for the session browser and usage import.
- If you are on v3.19.2 with a WSL-hosted config directory, existing configurations cannot be updated or switched on that version — upgrade directly to this release.
- Windows machines installed from any MSI between v3.4.0 and v3.19.2 keep a stale `HKCU\Software{{manufacturer}}{{product_name}}` registry key after upgrading; the fix does not delete it. Remove it manually with regedit if you want it gone — note that deleting it may trigger a one-time Windows Installer repair prompt, since it was registered as the install's key path.
- ChatGPT accounts signed in to the Auth Center before this release predate the persisted id_token and show a "Re-login required" badge; sign them in once more before binding them to a provider card. A ChatGPT login already wiped by the pre-fix takeover-restore bug is likewise not restored — run `codex login` once.
- If the built-in Codex official card was in your auto-failover queue, it is now filtered out and Auto mode will not start from an official card; pick a third-party Codex provider as the primary instead.
- On WSL or exFAT config directories, stopping Codex takeover now refuses the restore with a clear "filesystem does not support safe recovery" error instead of risking a half-written auth file. Nothing is deleted, but the pre-takeover credentials are not written back either — run `codex login` again afterwards, or keep the Codex directory on a filesystem that supports the safety probe.
- Preset changes apply only to newly created providers — a stored provider keeps the settings it was created with. That covers, in this release: the Volcengine Agent Plan endpoints, the ModelScope/Novita/Nvidia thinking dialects, Kimi reasoning effort, BytePlus native Responses, the SiliconFlow/ModelScope model-id replacements, OpenCode Go's direct connection and 1M context window, the pre-filled reasoning tiers, and RunAPI's new domain. Re-create the provider from the preset (or edit the relevant field) to pick these up. Exceptions that do apply to existing providers immediately: the Kimi passthrough change, the platform inference corrections (ModelScope, StepFun, opencode.ai) for providers without a stored reasoning declaration, quota detection for Volcengine Agent Plan endpoints, and the corrected DeepSeek vendor catalog on the provider's next switch.
- If an earlier version already rewrote `model_catalog_json` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, this release does not restore your original pointer — point it back at your own file once, and it will be left alone from then on. While it points at a user-owned file, CC Switch's per-provider model table (display names, context windows, reasoning levels) does not reach Codex.
- Saving an existing Grok Build provider through the form now pins its stored `api_backend` to `responses` — written to the live config immediately if it is the current provider, otherwise on the next switch to it; the upstream protocol is set via Advanced → Upstream Format instead.
- Text corrupted by the IME bug before this release stays corrupted in the database and live configs — re-edit the affected provider name/key/model fields once.
- DeepSeek V4 costs in the dashboard rise sharply going forward — roughly 3x on input, 4.5–4.7x on output, and 5x (Flash) to 12x (Pro) on cache reads; that is the vendor's new peak-tier list price, not an accounting change. Costs are frozen at log time, so history is not re-priced — except that previously-unpriced `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` rows are backfilled from $0, at the current peak-tier rate rather than what DeepSeek charged at the time, so those historical totals read high. Manually edited prices are never touched. Gemini 3.7 Flash is seeded at its introductory price, which the vendor lists through 2026.
- SQL backups exported by earlier versions keep their old fidelity loss — export a fresh backup if you rely on exact round-tripping. A truncated or table-missing SQL file is now rejected at import where an earlier version might have accepted it; and restoring a `.db` backup now rewrites the live config files of every managed app except Pi from the restored database, where it previously changed only the database.
- With WebDAV/S3 auto-sync enabled, project-profile edits now queue snapshot uploads they previously did not.
- Claude Code WebSearch requests carrying constraints the Responses API cannot represent (`blocked_domains`, non-direct callers, `response_inclusion`, or `max_uses` on Codex OAuth without forcing the tool) now fail with an explicit error instead of searching more broadly than asked; Chat-format upstreams still do not serve hosted WebSearch.
- If a Kimi endpoint starts returning thinking-related 400 errors after upgrading, first check the `thinking`/`reasoning_effort` fields the re-added presets now send — Moonshot's parameter page and its Codex integration guide disagree on whether kimi-k3 accepts `thinking`, and the presets follow the guide. Only a 400 demanding that thinking history be passed back would point at the removed history injection instead.

## [3.19.2] - 2026-08-06

Development since v3.19.1 is a correctness and hardening pass, with the management UI picking up its two most-requested conveniences. The headline fix is to Codex usage accounting: a rollout file that interleaves several cumulative token counters — a gateway replaying the same snapshot under different rate-limit buckets, or two genuinely distinct counters alternating — could record several times its true usage, and the importer now recognizes both shapes; replaying a real corpus of ~1,900 rollout files lands within 0.001% of an independently computed ideal recount (#3011). A six-part security hardening caps every unbounded read a contributor's audit surfaced — usage scripts, Grok session logs, catalog files, proxy response bodies and their decompression — and the deep-link import dialog now shows two credential fields it previously persisted without rendering. OMO setups regain a working integration on two fronts: when OMO's unified config (`~/.omo/omo.jsonc` or `omo.json`) exists, writes land inside it instead of the legacy file the runtime no longer reads, and the model pickers merge in whatever the installed OpenCode reports at runtime. The MCP, prompt and skill panels gain search, with bulk per-app toggles joining the MCP and skill lists; the Auth Center shows each ChatGPT account's subscription usage inline; and two write-path overhauls — batched SQL backups and batched Codex session imports — cut the worst restore, sync and reimport stalls on large databases.

**Stats**: 24 commits | 109 files changed | +12,340 insertions | -1,897 deletions

### Added

- **Search and Bulk Per-App Toggles in the Management Panels**: The MCP, prompt and skill panels gain a shared search box — Esc clears it, and it only intercepts the global back shortcut while non-empty — and the per-app count badges on the MCP and skill lists become three-state checkbox buttons that enable or disable an app across every listed entry at once. Bulk operations run sequentially rather than in parallel, because each app's live config is a single file and concurrent writes would overwrite each other; failures are collected and reported together. Deliberately, a bulk toggle acts on the full list, not the search-filtered subset. Two database-layer fixes ride along: MCP toggles moved from read-whole-row/save-whole-row to a single-column atomic UPDATE, closing a pre-existing lost-update race when two apps were toggled near-simultaneously, and skill updates re-confirm the record still exists with its install generation unchanged before writing, so a slow update task can no longer resurrect a just-uninstalled skill. The search index is an explicit whitelist — env values and headers are never part of the searchable text. (#5954, #5935)
- **Per-Account Subscription Usage in the Auth Center**: Settings → Auth Center now shows each ChatGPT (Codex OAuth) account's subscription usage inline, reusing the exact query the provider card footer already runs — shared by account id, cached for five minutes, fetched once on mount without polling. Frontend-only change. (#4887)
- **OMO Model Pickers Fed by the Runtime's Own Model List**: The OMO form's model selectors previously offered a static list; they now also run `opencode models` and merge in what the installed OpenCode actually reports. The helper process is sandboxed deliberately: project-level config discovery is disabled and the working directory is pinned to the OpenCode config dir, so opening a form can never execute a project's `.opencode/` plugins; it runs under a 20-second deadline, and on timeout the whole process tree is killed — process groups on macOS/Linux, `taskkill /T` on Windows, and an in-distro `timeout` for WSL installs. Any failure falls back to the static list with a warning toast. (#5522)
- **Built-In Pricing for Qwen3.8 Max**: `qwen3.8-max` is seeded insert-if-absent at $2/$6 per million input/output tokens, with $0.25 cache read and $2.50 cache write (125% of input, the official explicit context-cache rate). As always, a price you already customized is untouched. (#6053)

### Changed

- **Partner Roster Maintenance**: The NekoCode and Unity2.ai partner presets are removed from all apps, the README and every locale. The Kimi preset and README entry surface the vendor's first top-up bonus, and RunAPI's in-app promo line moves to a first top-up discount. Qiniu moves next to AIGoCode in preset order.

### Fixed

- **Codex Usage Over-Counted When Token Counters Interleaved**: The Codex session importer derived usage deltas from a single high-water mark over cumulative totals, which double-counts when a rollout file interleaves counters — either a gateway replaying the same unchanged snapshot under a different rate-limit id, or two genuinely distinct cumulative counters alternating. Files from the field measured six to eight times their true usage. The importer now prefers each event's explicit last-turn usage and recognizes replayed snapshots by their full token signature; a snapshot is only deduplicated against the same source's own last signature or the immediately preceding token event, so a legitimate counter reset is never swallowed, and the total-only fallback keeps a single global baseline. Replaying a ~1,900-file / 1.7 GB real corpus lands within 0.001% of an independently computed ideal, and the residual differences are legitimate recoveries of counter resets the old code clamped away. Historical rows are deliberately not rewritten — see Upgrade notes. (#3011, #3015)
- **Dropped Chat Tool Calls Now Fail the Turn Instead of Faking Completion**: When a third-party Chat gateway returns tool calls without a function name, the Chat → Responses transform silently discarded them and still reported the turn as `completed` — Codex saw a successful turn with nothing left to do and ended its agent loop without any error, turning a diagnosable upstream failure into a silent stall. The transform now emits `response.failed` (streaming) or a transform error (non-streaming) when every tool call in a turn was dropped and none remains usable, gated on `status == "completed"` so that `finish_reason: length` truncation keeps its own `incomplete` semantics. All three drop sites log structured, content-free fields — call-id presence, argument byte counts, finish reason — so the upstream defect behind #4341 can finally be diagnosed from real traffic. Turns that still contain a valid tool call, text-only turns and truncated turns are unaffected. (#4341)
- **OMO Writes Went to a File OMO No Longer Reads**: OMO 4.19.3 unified its configuration into `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` (falling back to `omo.json`) and its migration renames the legacy per-app file away — after which CC Switch, which only knew the legacy path, kept writing a file outside OMO's config chain, so provider switches appeared to succeed but never took effect. CC Switch now detects the unified file and writes the OpenCode section inside OMO's `"[opencode]"` key — and only there, because OMO validates its root schema strictly and discards the entire file over any unknown root key. Edits preserve the document as JSON5: comments, key order and line endings survive, nothing is written when nothing changed, and every write is verified by re-parsing the output and comparing it semantically against the intended result — if the round-trip would corrupt the document, the write is refused and the file left untouched rather than saved corrupted (see Upgrade notes for the one known trigger). The same change also hardened atomic file writes on Windows for every managed app, replacing the remove-then-rename sequence — which had a brief window where the target file did not exist — with `ReplaceFileW`. (#5945)
- **GitHub Copilot Takeover Left Modern Claude Code Logged Out**: Current Claude Code releases show a confirmation dialog for an unrecognized API key, defaulting to "No (recommended)" — so the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` placeholder that Copilot takeover wrote left users in an unauthenticated session unless they overrode the default. Takeover now writes the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` placeholder instead, which enters the session without any prompt; a provider whose credential field explicitly selects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the form's advanced options keeps the old behavior. The Copilot forwarding path also gains the `[1M]` context-marker strip that the other forwarding paths already had, so a `claude-*[1M]` model id no longer reaches GitHub's API verbatim. (#5832)
- **Hermes Prompts Were Written to a File Hermes Never Reads**: Hermes loads its persona file `SOUL.md` from `~/.hermes/` and never looks for `AGENTS.md` there — that name is project-level context discovered from the working directory upward. CC Switch's prompt management wrote `~/.hermes/AGENTS.md` from the day Hermes support was added, so enabling a Hermes prompt produced a dead file. Prompts now read and write `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`, and the existing back-fill still applies: a SOUL.md you wrote yourself is imported into the database before being replaced. (#5777)
- **Skill Installs Failed on Repos With a Same-Name Wrapper Directory**: Installing ast-grep's official skill failed with a missing-SKILL.md error: the repository keeps a wrapper directory named like the skill, with the real skill nested below it, and the resolver returned the first directory whose name matched. Source resolution is now anchored on SKILL.md itself — a directory without one is never selected — which also stops update checks against such repositories from reporting a permanent phantom update. (#4141)
- **skills.sh Installs of Nested Skills Produced 404 Documentation Links**: The skills.sh discovery flow reports only a skill's basename; installation resolved the real nested directory, but the stored README link was still derived from the basename guess, yielding a 404. The link is now built from the directory the installer actually resolved. The fix is install-only — records written by earlier versions keep their broken link until the skill is reinstalled, see Upgrade notes. (#6111)
- **Header Actions Clipped When Every App Was Enabled**: With all app tabs, the profile switcher and the takeover toggles visible, the header overflowed and clipped the add-provider button. Primary actions now live in a fixed cluster, and the app switcher is width-aware: apps that no longer fit collapse into a "more" popover, with the active app always kept visible.
- **Idle GPU Use From the Route Status Heartbeat**: The route status indicator's pulse animation ran even when the window was unfocused, keeping the GPU ticking for a purely decorative effect. Window focus now gates the heartbeat through a data attribute and CSS — an unfocused window freezes the animation at full opacity, and reduced-motion preferences disable it entirely. Data polling is unchanged; only the decoration pauses. (#5767)

### Security

- **Every Unbounded Read on the Audit's List Is Now Capped, and the Deep-Link Dialog Shows Two Fields It Used to Hide**: A six-part hardening pass. Usage scripts — which can arrive via deep link or a synced database — ran on an unlimited JS runtime, so a `while(true)` hung the backend thread forever; the runtime now enforces a 5-second interrupt, a 16 MiB memory limit and a 256 KiB stack. Grok session-log collection skips files over 50 MiB, bounds directory recursion at 16 levels and no longer follows symlinks, so a symlink cycle under `~/.grok/sessions` can no longer overflow the stack. A `model_catalog_json` entry naming the cc-switch catalog file used to be trusted on filename alone, wherever its absolute path led; it must now resolve inside the Codex config directory — re-checked after `canonicalize`, so a symlink cannot escape — and catalog reads are capped at 32 MiB. Proxy response bodies collected in full — non-streaming responses, error bodies and full-body validation paths — are capped at 128 MiB, enforced as chunks arrive so the connection is dropped the moment the limit is crossed rather than after the fact; streaming paths, passthrough and streamed transforms alike, are never buffered in full and carry no total-size cap. Decompression is budgeted at the decoder's read side across gzip, deflate, zstd and brotli, so a compression bomb cannot expand unchecked; an oversized body maps to a distinct 502 rather than being mistaken for a retryable network error. Finally, the deep-link provider import dialog parsed and persisted `usageAccessToken` and `usageUserId` without ever rendering them; both now display — the token masked — before you approve the import. (#5919)

### Performance

- **SQL Backups Export in Batches and Restore in One Transaction**: Two separate costs, one per direction. The dump wrote one INSERT per row, so importing a large backup made SQLite parse, prepare and finalize tens of thousands of individual statements (the dump itself already ran inside one transaction); dumps now emit multi-row INSERTs batched at 200 rows / 1 MB, cutting the statement count by two orders of magnitude and the file size roughly 4×. Separately, after every WebDAV/S3 sync import the tables that stay local are restored row by row, and each row ran as its own implicit transaction — one full journal write-and-fsync cycle per row, which is what made the periodic auto-sync freeze the app on large databases; that restore now runs inside a single transaction. Old single-row exports still import, and the new format stays within limits every shipped SQLite accepts, so backups exchange cleanly across app versions in both directions. This likely alleviates the cross-machine import hangs reported in #2100 — feedback there is welcome. (#6122)
- **Full Codex Usage Reimports Are ~3× Faster, More on Windows**: A full reimport — triggered by importing a pre-v16 SQL backup, a cursor mismatch after a cross-machine restore, or a manual rebuild — pegged one CPU core for minutes on large corpora: every token event was written in its own autocommit transaction, paying a full journal create/fsync/delete cycle per row, and every archived file re-ran a cursor-inheritance query that could not use an index. Token events now commit in batches of 1,000 with the connection lock released between batches so UI queries can interleave; the sync cursor advances in the same transaction as the final batch, so a crash can never leave the cursor ahead of the data; cursors and model pricing are preloaded once per pass; and the hot statements are prepared once and cached. A real corpus of 1,920 rollout files / 1.7 GB reimports in 11.1s instead of 36.3s on macOS (release build); Windows pays several milliseconds of fsync per row, so the absolute win there is an order of magnitude larger. Equivalence was verified by replaying the corpus before and after the change: all 82,000 imported rows byte-identical across every exported column, with identical import/skip counts.

### Docs

- **The Codex DeepSeek Routing Guide Now Matches v3.19.1's Direct Connection**: The guide used DeepSeek as its worked example for local Chat routing, which v3.19.1 made obsolete by moving the preset to native Responses. All three languages are updated, and the v3.19.1 release notes' pointer to the guide was corrected.

### Internal

- **CI Installs pnpm Through Corepack**: The workflows previously installed pnpm ad hoc; they now enable Corepack and respect the `packageManager` pin in `package.json`, so CI and local installs resolve the same pnpm version. CONTRIBUTING documents the behavior, including that a contributor's first `pnpm` invocation after `corepack enable` downloads and pins the declared version. (#5919)

### Upgrade notes

- No database schema migration in this release — `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays at 16, so no pre-migration backup is triggered.
- The Codex interleaved-counter fix corrects accounting going forward only: historical rows are deliberately not rewritten, and no automatic rebuild runs. If your dashboard shows implausibly high Codex figures and your rollout files carry the interleaved pattern, trigger a manual Codex usage rebuild after upgrading — this release's import batching makes that rebuild roughly 3× faster than it would have been. Most installations are unaffected: outside the interleaved pattern, the old and new algorithms agree to within a fraction of a percent.
- skills.sh nested skills installed before this release keep their broken README link; uninstalling and reinstalling the skill rewrites it. Updating the skill in place does not.
- The first WebDAV/S3 sync after upgrading re-uploads `db.sql`, because the dump format changed and the sync protocol hashes it as an opaque artifact — a benign, one-time retransfer.
- The Copilot `AUTH_TOKEN` placeholder applies when takeover next rewrites the live config — switching providers or restarting takeover. If you explicitly set the credential field to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the provider form's advanced options, that choice is honored unchanged.
- Unified OMO config detection is by file presence, not version: when `~/.omo/omo.jsonc` (or `omo.json`) exists, CC Switch edits it in place; when neither exists, it keeps writing the legacy OpenCode-level file as before. Known limitation: if that file contains block comments (`/* … */`), writes are refused with an error to protect the document — line comments (`//`) are unaffected. Remove block comments to switch providers until the upstream JSON5 writer is fixed.
- Bulk app toggles in the management panels act on the entire list, not the search-filtered subset.
- Proxy responses that must be buffered — non-streaming responses and error bodies — now fail with a 502 when they exceed 128 MiB instead of being forwarded; pass-through streaming responses are unaffected. Normal LLM responses are megabytes at most, so this should only trigger on a malfunctioning upstream; note that this class of failure terminates the request and does not trip failover to the next address.

## [3.19.1] - 2026-07-31

Development since v3.19.0 is a maintenance pass rather than a feature wave — and the first release in this project's history that deletes more than it adds. Three Chinese Codex gateways move onto native Responses and no longer need local routing takeover: DeepSeek connects straight to `api.deepseek.com` and brings with it a general mechanism for mirroring a vendor's own model catalog verbatim, so the GPT-5 harness and the freeform `apply_patch` registration stay self-consistent instead of collapsing into the neutral template; Volcengine's Ark Coding Plan follows now that the official documentation confirms `/api/coding/v3` serves Responses; and Tencent Hunyuan's TokenHub joins as a new preset. The correctness sweep covers four failures visible in the field: Claude Desktop usage has been counted twice since v3.18.0, once as a proxy row and once as an imported session row (#5938); switching back to the built-in official Codex provider left a third-party key in `auth.json`, so Codex authenticated to the official endpoint with the wrong credential and returned 401 without ever falling through to its login screen; `grok update` failed from Settings with a bare `os error 2` because a GUI-launched app cannot see node; and Grok Build's proxy takeover returned 404 on any non-Responses backend while every request minted a fresh session id (#5677). Rounding it out, nine interface strings that rendered as Simplified Chinese in every language are localized and the Traditional Chinese About page gains the thirty tool-manager strings it was missing, eight models that silently billed at zero gain built-in prices, deep-link import confirmations mask more and truncate less, and 3,166 lines of superseded code plus four npm dependencies are removed.

### Added

- **Official Vendor Model Catalogs Mirrored for Native Responses Providers**: Codex reads model capabilities from a catalog file, and CC Switch generated every provider's catalog from a neutral template — which is right for an aggregator, but strips capabilities a vendor's own integration depends on. A vendor whose published catalog is bundled with the app is now mirrored verbatim instead. DeepSeek is the first: `src-tauri/src/resources/codex_deepseek_catalog_template.json` carries its `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro` entries with `apply_patch_tool_type: "freeform"`, `web_search_tool_type: "text"`, `supports_search_tool: true`, the low/high/max reasoning levels, and the 17,644-character GPT-5 harness in `base_instructions` and `model_messages` — which has to travel together with the freeform tool registration, because the harness instructs the model to use `apply_patch`. The gate is deliberately narrow: the provider must resolve to the native-Responses profile **and** its `base_url` must be on `deepseek.com`. Matching is by host only and never by model brand, because these entries grant capabilities that an aggregator reselling the same model may not implement. Explicit per-model overrides in the provider's own catalog still win, and an unrecognised model id clones the flagship entry while keeping its own slug. Every other provider profile emits exactly the catalog it did before.
- **Tencent Hunyuan (TokenHub) Codex Preset**: A "Tencent Hunyuan" entry joins the Codex preset picker under the Opensource Official category, between Bailian and StepFun. It writes `https://tokenhub.tencentmaas.com/v1` with `wire_api = "responses"` and the `disable_response_storage = true` that TokenHub requires, declares `hy3` and `hy3-preview` at a 256K context window (rather than accepting Codex's 128K default), and marks both text-only so `view_image` payloads are never sent to a model that cannot read them. Because it is a native Responses provider, Codex talks to the gateway directly and no local routing is needed; the generated catalog uses the neutral native template, which pins `shell_type = "shell_command"` and drops the freeform `apply_patch` registration that native gateways reject. The address manager and latency test see two candidates from the start — the primary `.com` host and the official `.cn` backup. The region-scoped international site is deliberately excluded, since API keys do not carry across sites. Note that the API key must be a TokenHub key created with the Hy3 scope; Coding Plan and Token Plan subscription keys do not work against this endpoint.
- **Built-In Pricing for Eight Models That Billed at Zero**: `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed` (2x its `kimi-k2.7-code` base, matching Kimi's Turbo pattern), `glm-5-turbo`, `glm-5v-turbo` and `qwen3.6-flash` had no row in the built-in pricing table and could not be reached by the prefix fallback, so every request against them was recorded at zero cost. Two more rows, bare `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude-sonnet-4-6`, close a subtler gap: model-id resolution strips a date suffix but never adds one, so a log row carrying the undated id matched nothing at all. All eight are seeded insert-if-absent, so a price you already customized is untouched.
- **Grok Build Joins the Failover Tabs and the Environment-Conflict Check**: The failover settings gain a fourth tab for Grok Build alongside Claude Code, Codex and Gemini, and the startup environment-conflict banner now detects a shell-exported `XAI_API_KEY` or `GROK_DEFAULT_MODEL` — variables that silently override whatever provider is selected. Detection distinguishes exact names from prefixes, so CC Switch's own `GROK_BIN_DIR` and `GROK_HOME` are not reported.

### Changed

- **DeepSeek and Volcengine Ark Coding Plan Connect to Codex Directly, Without Local Routing**: Both presets were declared OpenAI Chat, which made them takeover-required: the provider card carried the "needs routing" badge, switching with the proxy off raised the routing prompt, and every request travelled Codex → local proxy → Responses-to-Chat conversion → upstream. Both vendors now publish official Codex integrations confirming their endpoints serve the Responses API — DeepSeek's `api.deepseek.com` and Volcengine's `/api/coding/v3` — so both presets declare native Responses, the badge and the prompt disappear, and Codex connects straight to the gateway. The generated `config.toml` is unchanged in both cases, since it already emitted `wire_api = "responses"`; what changes is the catalog profile and, for DeepSeek, the context window, which moves from 1,000,000 to the vendor's own 1,048,576. BytePlus deliberately stays on Chat routing until the international site's documentation is verified separately. The Volcengine preset also gained a comment recording a billing rule worth knowing: the pay-as-you-go `/api/v3` endpoint must never be added to this preset's backup addresses, because it bills separately instead of drawing down plan quota.
- **Catalog `displayName` and `contextWindow` Are Now Explicit-Only**: Both fields previously carried local defaults — the model id and a 128,000-token window — applied before a vendor value could be consulted, so a mirrored catalog would have had its 1M window overwritten with 128K. They are now optional, with the fallbacks applied one level down at entry construction, which makes "left blank" mean "keep whatever the vendor declared". Providers that set the fields explicitly, and every non-mirrored profile, emit identical catalogs to before.

### Fixed

- **Claude Desktop Usage Was Counted Twice**: Claude Desktop traffic through the local gateway landed in the usage dashboard once as a proxy row and once more as an imported transcript row, so its tokens, cost and request counts read roughly double. The regression shipped in v3.18.0: proxy dedup ids were scoped as `session:{app_type}:{provider_id}:{message_id}` for every app except `claude`, which put `claude-desktop` in its own namespace while the transcript importer kept writing the same Claude message under the bare `session:{message_id}` shape with `app_type = 'claude'`. All three dedup defenses failed at once — the primary-key convergence that lets a proxy row absorb an existing session row, the write-side fingerprint probe, and the read-side filter, the latter two both comparing `app_type` with strict equality. The two apps now share the bare namespace again, and the two comparisons are widened by a one-way rule where a `claude` session row can be absorbed by a `claude-desktop` proxy row but never the reverse. Because the read-side filter is also what daily rollups aggregate through, already-stored duplicates stop being counted without any row being rewritten or deleted — see Upgrade notes for the retention limit on that. For Codex, Gemini and OpenCode the widened comparison collapses to the previous exact match, and quota checks keep strict app matching. (#5938, #5951)
- **Switching Back to the Official Codex Provider Stranded You on a 401 With No Login Screen**: With Codex API-key preservation off (the default), switching to a third-party provider writes that vendor's key into `~/.codex/auth.json`. Switching afterwards to a built-in official provider — whose stored credentials are empty — took the config-only write path, so `config.toml` was replaced while the third-party `OPENAI_API_KEY` stayed on disk. Codex then authenticated to the official endpoint with a foreign key and got 401, and because `auth.json` existed it never fell through to its own login screen, leaving no way out from inside the app. After a successful switch to an official Codex provider, CC Switch now deletes an `auth.json` that contains only an `OPENAI_API_KEY` with no first-class credential beside it — OAuth tokens, a personal access token, an agent identity or a Bedrock key all mark the file as real and leave it untouched, while metadata such as `auth_mode`, `last_refresh` or an account id can no longer shield a stale key. Deleting rather than writing `{}` is deliberate: an empty object resolves to ChatGPT mode without tokens and errors at bootstrap, whereas a missing file yields the login screen. The cleanup runs only after the outgoing provider has been backfilled into the database, so the removed key is preserved and comes back when that provider is selected again. Live-config reads were relaxed in the same change so the post-cleanup state — no `auth.json`, an existing `config.toml` — is no longer reported as "Codex is not installed".
- **Grok Build Upgrades From Settings Failed With a Bare `os error 2`**: Upgrading Grok Build from Settings → About failed with `Error: No such file or directory (os error 2)` and nothing else. The cause is an asymmetry between how CC Switch probes tools and how it runs them: probing goes through a login shell, which sources the user's rc files and therefore sees nvm, Homebrew and Volta, while lifecycle scripts ran under a non-login shell inheriting the narrow PATH a GUI app is launched with. That normally does not matter, because anchored commands invoke binaries by absolute path — but grok 0.2.112 moved self-update onto npm distribution, so `grok update` now spawns `npm view` and `npm i -g` internally, and npm resolves node through its own shebang. The inner spawn returned ENOENT, which grok surfaced as the bare error. Lifecycle commands on macOS and Linux now run with the login shell's real PATH merged ahead of the inherited one, read through `/usr/bin/env` rather than by echoing the variable, because fish stores PATH as a list and would emit space-separated segments. Native Grok's update additionally chains the official xAI installer as a fallback — deliberately not `npm i -g`, which shares both of the primary's failure modes; the installer is the only node-free path, lands in the same location, and rewrites the CLI's own `installer` setting back to `internal`, healing users whom an earlier npm fallback had moved onto npm distribution.
- **Grok Build Proxy Takeover Returned 404, and Every Request Looked Like a New Session**: Enabling takeover on a Grok Build provider whose API format was OpenAI Chat or Anthropic produced an immediate 404 with no failover and no usage record — takeover rewrote the base URL and key but left the backend field alone, so the CLI posted to a route the proxy does not register. Takeover now also pins the backend to Responses; the per-provider downgrade to Chat Completions still happens inside the forwarder, and the forced value reverts with the whole live config when the proxy stops. Separately, proxy session extraction recognised only Codex and OpenAI clients, so every Grok Build turn minted a fresh session id marked as not client-provided, which suppressed prompt-cache key injection and per-session grouping in the usage dashboard. Grok's own headers are now read — the conversation id first, then the session id, ignoring the per-request id — under a distinct `grokbuild_` prefix so its rows cannot collide with Codex's. (#5677)
- **Nine Interface Strings Rendered as Simplified Chinese in Every Language**: Nine strings appeared in Simplified Chinese regardless of the selected language, English and Japanese included. Each call site used the inline-default form with a Chinese literal, but the key existed in none of the four locale files — and i18next resolves a key through the language chain before it considers an inline default, so the English fallback never engaged and the Chinese literal won everywhere. The affected strings cover the Grok Build provider form's validation toast, the failover tooltip shown when an app is not yet taken over, the warning raised when stopping Claude Desktop routing while another app holds takeover and the reason line that explains why routing must start, the duplicate-provider id read failure, the empty Codex common-config error, the routing service's stop and stop-failed toasts, and the "unpriced" cost label the usage tables show for a request that carries tokens but computes to zero. All nine now exist in Chinese, English, Japanese and Traditional Chinese. (#5960)
- **The Traditional Chinese About Page Fell Back to English in the Tool Manager**: With the interface set to Traditional Chinese, the tool management section of the About page rendered in English — version rows, install and update buttons, result toasts, the install-conflict diagnosis and the entire upgrade-confirmation dialog. The panel was built out across three earlier changes that added labels to Chinese, English and Japanese only, and because i18next falls back to English rather than failing, thirty missing keys were invisible in testing. This gap shipped in every release from v3.16.0 through v3.19.0. All thirty strings are now translated, the install hint was brought in line with the other locales, and a new locale test asserts that every tool-management label exists in all four languages with matching interpolation variables, so this class of drift fails the suite instead of shipping. (#5943)
- **Seeded Model Prices Disagreed With Vendor List Prices**: Costs are frozen at log time from the built-in pricing table, so a stale seed quietly mis-bills every subsequent request. Four rows were corrected: `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` are now legacy aliases of V4 Flash at $0.14/$0.28 per million input/output with $0.0028 cache read (from $0.27/$1.10 and $0.55/$2.19); `minimax-m3` halves to $0.30/$1.20, the official standard tier; and `gpt-5.6-luna` drops 80% to $0.20/$1.20 while `gpt-5.6-terra` drops 20% to $2/$12, following OpenAI's 2026-07-30 price cut, with `gpt-5.6-sol` deliberately unchanged and the family's cache-write ratio preserved. The repairs rewrite a row only when all four of its cost columns still hold the exact previous built-in values, so a price you edited yourself — or one set by models.dev sync — is never touched.

### Security

- **Deep-Link Import Confirmations Mask More and Truncate Less**: A continuation of the `ccswitch://` confirmation hardening in v3.19.0. Config previews are now built by one shared module that masks secrets recursively through nested TOML tables and JSON objects, which fixes two opposite defects: a Grok Build import rendered no configuration preview at all, while a Codex import printed embedded `api_key` values in the clear. The 300-character truncation on the configuration preview is gone — the full document now renders inside a scrollable box, closing the last place the confirmation could hide part of what it was about to write. Masking itself is stricter everywhere it is used, including the MCP import confirmation: the sensitive-name matcher gained `AUTHORIZATION`, `COOKIE` and `CREDENTIAL` alongside exact matches for `AUTH` and `BEARER`, masked values reveal four leading characters instead of eight, and a value of eight characters or fewer is now replaced entirely rather than shown. Finally, the frontend Base64 decoder no longer trims surrounding whitespace, which could discard a `+` that URL decoding had turned into a space — the same class of frontend/backend decoder divergence fixed in v3.19.0, where the dialog shows one thing and the importer writes another.

### Internal

- **Superseded Code Removed: 3,166 Lines, Fourteen Modules and Four Dependencies**: A deletion pass over code that had no caller. On the Rust side it drops the provider icon inference table, a placeholder health checker, a second never-wired SSE implementation with its own stream and non-stream handlers, two unused proxy session types, and four unreferenced usage parsers along with a dead cost-calculation entry point — the live billing path, its auto-detecting parsers and session id extraction are untouched. Twenty-two `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions, which are why the compiler never flagged any of it, go with them. On the front end, fourteen modules with no importer are deleted, including a prompt form modal and a repository manager both superseded by panel rewrites, a duplicate proxy config hook, a circuit-breaker panel that never had an importer in the project's history, and three schema files; their strings are removed identically from all four locales. The Tauri commands behind them are deliberately kept. Four unused npm dependencies are dropped. Two icon-extraction scripts that regenerated the hand-curated icon index are removed, and the index header now states that automatic regeneration is intentionally unsupported. A companion change consolidates proxy status and takeover state onto a single React Query layer — a second, parallel set of hooks over the same commands had zero call sites, so its query keys never had an observer and the invalidations aimed at them were no-ops. Query key strings are byte-identical and the surviving hook keeps its existing poll behavior. (#5916, #5928)

### Upgrade notes

- No database schema migration in this release — `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays at 16, so no pre-migration backup is triggered.
- Claude Desktop's double-counted usage corrects itself retroactively, but only within the detail-row retention window. The fix suppresses duplicate rows at query time rather than rewriting or deleting anything, so every affected day whose detail rows are still present recovers its correct total on next launch. Detail rows older than 30 days are aggregated into daily rollups and pruned, and a day already rolled up by a build without this fix keeps its inflated figure permanently. The regression entered with v3.18.0 (2026-07-21).
- The eight newly priced models are re-costed retroactively where possible: startup backfills requests that were logged with zero cost, so dashboard totals for those models will rise. Rows already rolled up and pruned stay at zero. The four repriced models work the other way — backfill only touches zero-cost rows, so requests already logged keep the old rate and only new requests bill at the new one; historical and current spend for the same model will differ. Manual price edits, models.dev sync values and deletion tombstones are re-applied after seeding and always win.
- Preset changes apply only to newly created providers. A DeepSeek or Volcengine Ark Coding Plan provider already saved keeps its stored API format, keeps requiring local routing, and keeps its old catalog; re-create it from the preset, or switch the API format in the provider form, to get the direct connection. A provider that is already on native Responses with a `deepseek.com` base URL picks up the mirrored official catalog on its next switch without any re-save, because the gate reads the live configuration.
- `deepseek-v4-pro` cannot be used over the direct connection yet. It stays listed in the preset, and in the mirrored vendor catalog, but DeepSeek has not opened its Codex integration for that model — early August 2026 by their own estimate — so selecting it while the provider is on native Responses fails upstream. Use `deepseek-v4-flash`, which is the preset default and unaffected. To use pro today, switch that provider's API format back to OpenAI Chat and enable local routing takeover: that is the path DeepSeek took before this release, and the proxy's Responses-to-Chat conversion serves pro exactly as it did.
- The mirrored DeepSeek catalog declares a minimum Codex client version of 0.144.0, which CC Switch does not verify — the freeform `apply_patch` registration it carries needs that release or newer. The generated catalog file also grows to roughly 75 KB for the two mirrored models, since each carries the full harness text.
- Because DeepSeek, Volcengine Ark Coding Plan and Tencent Hunyuan no longer require takeover, their traffic can bypass the local proxy entirely, and per-request proxy usage accounting does not see it. The usage itself is neither lost nor indistinguishable — Codex session-log import still records it — but that path carries no provider identity: all Codex usage that did not go through the local proxy is grouped under a single `Codex (Session)` entry, official-subscription consumption included. So a provider moving from routed to direct also moves its usage out from under its own name. Model attribution is unaffected: every row keeps its model id, and the usage panel's per-model table still separates `deepseek-v4-flash`, `hy3`, `ark-code-latest` and the official GPT models into their own rows with their own token and cost figures. Keep local routing takeover enabled only if you need the provider dimension specifically — for instance to compare the same model across several aggregators.
- The stale Codex `auth.json` cleanup is gated on the incoming provider carrying the explicit official category and on the outgoing provider being backfilled successfully. An official entry created by hand without that category, or a switch whose backfill failed, still leaves the residue behind.
- Enabling proxy takeover on a Grok Build provider now rewrites its backend to Responses in the live configuration. The stored provider row is untouched and the live file is restored from its backup when the proxy stops.
- On macOS and Linux, every tool install and update triggered from Settings → About now runs with the login shell's PATH merged ahead of the inherited one, so a binary a lifecycle script resolves by name may resolve differently than before; each action also spawns one extra shell to read that PATH, which executes the user's interactive startup files. Windows is unchanged. Users on grok 0.2.112 or later may see two enumerated installations — the native one plus a global npm package that `grok update` created itself; they are kept in sync upstream and report the same version.
- Environment-conflict detection for Claude Code, Codex and Gemini moved from substring to prefix matching, so variables that merely contain an app's name — `MY_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OLD_GEMINI_API_KEY` — are no longer reported as conflicts.
- Deep-link import confirmations now reveal less of each secret than before: four leading characters instead of eight, and values of eight characters or fewer are masked entirely.

## [3.19.0] - 2026-07-30

Development since v3.18.0 is headlined by a security-hardening wave and a proxy correctness fix with immediate field impact. On the security side (#5811 and follow-ups): skill installs from GitHub repositories are hardened against zip-slip and repository-coordinate path traversal with hard archive limits; a Gemini common-config credential leak is closed and a one-time startup cleanup scrubs keys that already leaked into other providers' configs; imported SQL backups now run under a SQLite authorizer that denies `ATTACH` and every other statement that can reach outside the import database; common-config snippet handling no longer follows `__proto__` into the global prototype; terminal launch escapes project paths with POSIX single quotes so a directory name can no longer inject commands; and `ccswitch://` import confirmations show every argument, env var, URL, and the complete usage-script body — nothing hidden by truncation, nor by a Base64 variant the dialog could not decode, credential-shaped values masked — flag risky values, and import usage scripts disabled by default. On the proxy side, tool-result images are lifted out of stringified tool text and re-emitted as native media on every conversion bridge, ending the ~9,000× token inflation that pushed Codex sessions past their context window after a few screenshots (#4465, #5663). Usage statistics gain opt-in automatic price sync from models.dev with a persistent local override file (#5734), plus coverage of Grok CLI's official OAuth mode imported from session logs and SuperGrok subscription quota on provider cards. Rounding it out: in-app updates are served from a Cloudflare R2 mirror at `dl.ccswitch.io` with GitHub as fallback, Codex usage import reuses parsed parent rollouts across forked sessions (#5626), preset defaults advance to Claude Opus 5, GPT-5.6 Sol, and Gemini 3.6 Flash, the OpenClaw Kimi For Coding base URL is corrected, and the GPT-in-Claude-Code routing guide is now available in English and Japanese.

### Added

- **Automatic models.dev Pricing Sync**: The Usage panel's pricing section gains an opt-in (off by default) "Automatic models.dev pricing sync" card: once enabled, CC Switch refreshes the selected models' prices from models.dev at launch, at most once every six hours, overwriting built-in or hand-edited prices that share the same normalized model ID — enabling shows a confirmation that spells this out. A "Choose models" dialog exposes the full models.dev catalog with search and filtering, alongside an "automatically include common models" option that tracks the most recent Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Qwen, MiMo, LongCat, Kimi, MiniMax, and GLM releases (up to six per family, individually excludable). The card shows the last sync time and last error, offers "Sync now", and can open or reload the local pricing file. From this version onward, manual price overrides and deletions are also recorded in a human-editable `~/.cc-switch/model-pricing.json` next to the database and re-applied at every startup, so they survive database rebuilds — and deleting a built-in price finally sticks across restarts via a tombstone instead of being re-seeded. The file starts empty and deliberately does not back-fill from the existing pricing table, so price edits made before this version still live only in the database until you re-save them. Whenever a sync actually changes a price, historical usage rows that never got a cost (zero or missing) are backfilled at the new price — rows already carrying a computed cost keep their original figures; a failed or offline fetch never blocks startup. Non-text and deprecated models (audio, image, video, embedding, moderation, realtime, TTS, transcription) are filtered out of the models.dev list, which also cleans up the existing manual price picker. (#5734)
- **Grok Build Usage Tracking in Official OAuth Mode**: Usage from Grok CLI's official OAuth mode — which cannot be routed through the local proxy, since Grok uses an empty config as the mode switch — is now recorded in the usage dashboard. Per-turn usage is imported from the `turn_completed` events in `~/.grok/sessions` (and archived sessions) `updates.jsonl` files as part of the regular session-log sync; costs prefer the exact figure the CLI reports and fall back to local pricing, with a `grok-4.5-build` row seeded at $2/$6 per million input/output tokens and $0.30 cache read. Imported rows are keyed on the upstream per-turn ID so rewinding a session cannot double count, and a settle window plus a recent-proxy-activity check prevents the same traffic being counted twice when routing is also in use. The rows appear under the provider name "Grok Build (Session)", the app filter gains a Grok Build option, and the data-source breakdown gains a "Grok Build Session" entry with its own icon, in all four languages.
- **SuperGrok Subscription Quota on Provider Cards**: Grok Build providers with category `official` now show SuperGrok subscription usage directly on the provider card, alongside the existing Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini official-subscription footers: CC Switch reads the Grok CLI's OAuth credentials from `~/.grok/auth.json` and queries the grok.com billing endpoint for the credit window's used percentage and reset time, labelling the window Weekly or Monthly when the reset distance identifies it, and otherwise a new "Credits" tier that appears as a `c` group in the tray usage summary. Transient network problems keep the last good reading and retry instead of blanking the footer; an expired token surfaces a hint to run `grok login` again. Managed xAI OAuth (SuperGrok) providers in the Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Codex sections render the same quota automatically from the account bound to the provider and hide their usage-script entry since the quota is built in. Note that Grok Build "officialness" is now decided solely by the provider's `category` field rather than by inspecting config contents.
- **Built-in Pricing for Claude Opus 5**: `claude-opus-5` joins the built-in pricing table at $5 / $25 per million input/output tokens, with $0.50 cache read and $6.25 cache write, so its usage no longer reports zero cost without a manual entry. Seeded insert-if-absent, so any price you already customized is untouched. (Opus 5 fast mode is billed through a separate path and deliberately not seeded.)
- **Preset Catalog Updates**: A6API — a token aggregator that lists several upstreams for the same model and routes to the cheaper, more stable one — joins the sponsor presets across all eight apps; the PackyCode preset gains three backup endpoints selectable in the address manager and latency test (on the five preset families that support endpoint candidates); the AICoding partner preset returns across seven app types; and sponsor ordering was re-synced so the in-app list matches the READMEs.

### Changed

- **Default Preset Models Upgraded to Claude Opus 5, GPT-5.6 Sol, and Gemini 3.6 Flash**: Built-in presets now default to the current model generation: `claude-opus-5` replaces `claude-opus-4-8` in all three naming forms, `gpt-5.6-sol` replaces `gpt-5.5` and bare `gpt-5.6`, and `gemini-3.6-flash` replaces `gemini-3.5-flash`. The same IDs were carried into everything that mirrors the presets — universal/NewAPI defaults, the Codex custom `config.toml` template, agent and category recommendations, form placeholders, and all four locales — and `gemini-3.6-flash` was added to the built-in pricing table ($1.50 / $7.50 per million input/output, $0.15 cache read) so it costs correctly out of the box. The Code0 and Qiniu Gemini presets, still pinned to `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, were brought onto the same 3.6 Flash baseline — a deliberate tier change, since there is no 3.6 Pro release and 3.5 Pro remains limited to partner testing.
- **In-App Updates Are Served From the ccswitch.io Mirror**: The updater now queries `https://dl.ccswitch.io/latest.json` — a Cloudflare R2 mirror of the release manifest — before falling back to GitHub Releases, so checking for and downloading updates no longer depends on GitHub being reachable, which is slow or blocked for many users. The mirrored manifest points every platform's download at the same bucket while minisign signatures are left untouched: they cover file contents rather than URLs, so each downloaded artifact is still verified against the public key baked into the app and the mirror itself remains untrusted. Publishing is handled by a release-gated sync workflow that only rewrites the root manifest when its tag really is GitHub's `releases/latest`, so the mirror can never push users backwards to an older version.
- **Faster Codex Usage Import for Forked Sessions**: Importing and rebuilding Codex usage statistics no longer re-reads the same parent rollout file once per fork point: each parent `~/.codex/sessions/*.jsonl` rollout is parsed once into an in-memory token timeline shared by every child session forked from it, with each child's cutoff resolved by an in-memory filter instead of another full-file scan. The cached timeline is validated against a file identity stamp (mtime, size, plus device/inode or Windows file ID), so an appended, rotated, or replaced parent file is re-read rather than served stale. The gain scales with fork density: heavily forked histories see a large reduction in redundant parsing, while a history with few forks is essentially unchanged — import results are byte-identical either way. (#5626)
- **Toolbar App Switcher Is Now Icon-Only**: The app switcher buttons no longer render text labels next to the icons — with eight managed apps the labels were collapsed by the overflow detection most of the time anyway, so the ResizeObserver-based auto-compact mechanism was removed and the switcher always shows icons. App names remain discoverable by hovering (tooltip) and stay accessible to screen readers via `aria-label`.
- **Sponsor Domains and Referral Links Refreshed**: Several sponsor providers moved to new domains, and their preset addresses, endpoint candidates, referral links, and README rows were updated accordingly (PackyCode → `www.packyapi.ai`, RightCode → `www.rightapi.ai`, ClaudeAPI → `www.apito.ai`, APINebula → `apinebula.ai`, AICodeMirror → `.ai`, AICoding → `.inc`, AIGoCode → `.app`), with two dead backup endpoints dropped along the way. Existing providers keep the base URL stored in the database — see Upgrade notes.

### Fixed

- **Tool-Result Images No Longer Blow Up Context Through the Proxy**: When a client read an image through a tool call — Codex's `view_image`, or any MCP tool that returns a picture — the proxy's protocol conversion serialized the entire image block into the text of the tool message, so the upstream tokenized the base64 payload as prose: roughly 9,000× inflation, where a single 113 KB PNG cost over 100,000 prompt tokens, and because Codex replays the whole history every turn, two or three screenshots were enough to push a session past the context limit and wedge it behind repeated 400s (#4465, #5663). The proxy now lifts media payloads out of tool results and re-emits them as native content on every conversion bridge — images everywhere, files and audio where the target protocol supports them: the two Chat bridges (Claude→Chat and Codex Responses→Chat) carry image, file, and audio parts, leaving a short marker in the tool message and attaching the media as a synthetic user message right after the tool batch, while Claude→Responses restores native `input_image` parts, Codex/GrokBuild→Anthropic rebuilds proper Anthropic image blocks, and Claude→Gemini uses multimodal `functionResponse.parts` on Gemini 3 (with `inlineData` parts for older models), accepting only inline base64 images. Detection covers typed Responses blocks, Anthropic `source` blocks, MCP `data`+`mimeType` results, and whole-string image data URLs, reached through arrays and nested `content` wrappers including inside JSON-encoded tool outputs; once an output is identified as media-bearing, residual data URLs and raw base64 blobs anywhere inside it are collapsed to a placeholder — bare base64 on its own is never treated as media. Tool results with no media keep their exact previous byte-for-byte representation on all bridges, so prompt-cache prefixes are unaffected, and the emitted media parts carry no `cache_control` markers that strict upstreams such as GLM and Qwen reject. An end-to-end run against Kimi K3 held a replayed turn at roughly 12k input tokens with a 99% cache hit, versus more than 85k of base64 text per replay before.
- **Unsupported-Image Fallback Now Reaches Images Buried in Tool Results**: The Unsupported Image Fallback setting replaces image blocks with a marker when a provider is text-only or the upstream rejects images, but it could only see images that were still structured blocks — tool-result images already flattened into base64 text were invisible to it, so a text-only upstream failed outright with no way to recover. The media sanitizer now detects and strips media inside tool outputs symmetrically on every path, so both the pre-send strip and the retry-after-rejection path can heal these turns; and because that check now looks inside tool results, a regression test pins that the reactive retry still fires only on genuine modality rejections — a context-length 400 is left alone rather than retried.
- **Grok Build Costs Overstated by the Cost Backfill**: The routine that recomputes missing costs treated only Codex and Gemini as providers whose reported input token counts already include cache reads. Grok Build uses the same convention, so any Grok Build row repaired by the backfill was priced on the full input count with cache reads billed a second time. The cache-inclusive provider set is now defined in one place and shared by the routing logger, the cost calculator, and the backfill, so the three can no longer disagree.
- **Hand-Edited Config Files No Longer Crash the App or Silently Swallow Edits**: A `~/.codex/config.toml` in which `mcp_servers` exists but is not a table made MCP sync panic mid-switch, after the database and live-config writes had already committed — leaving a half-applied switch; non-table values are now normalised to an empty table with a logged warning, in both the Codex and GrokBuild writers. Inline-table forms (valid TOML) had the mirrored problem: MCP removal silently did nothing while the UI reported success, and a `base_url` edit was written at a level Codex never reads — both now handled. An `opencode.json` whose root, `provider`, or `mcp` section is an array or scalar no longer panics; such files are rejected with an error rather than rebuilt, so the user's own settings are not destroyed. (#5811)
- **Proxy Transforms Survive Malformed Upstream Responses**: A non-object `message` or `content_block` in an Anthropic SSE stream, or a buffered body that is a top-level JSON array or scalar (what a gateway that ignores `stream: true` returns), could abort the local proxy instead of producing an error; the stream now bails out with a proper failed event. A malformed `content_block` header is additionally recovered as a text block — sanitising it to an empty object stopped the panic but silently dropped everything that followed — so the deltas after a garbled header come through, with a warning logged. (#5811)
- **OpenClaw Kimi For Coding Base URL Corrected**: The OpenClaw preset pointed at `https://api.kimi.com/v1`, the general platform endpoint, rather than the endpoint the Kimi For Coding subscription is served from, so the preset did not work with a coding-plan key. The base URL is now `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1`, with the form placeholder and default updated to match.

### Security

- **Gemini Common Config No Longer Leaks Credentials, With a One-Time Cleanup**: The Gemini common-config extractor stripped only `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` from the shared snippet and copied every other `env` entry verbatim — but `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is a first-class Gemini credential, so one account's key (along with anything else credential-shaped) was deep-merged into every other Gemini provider using the common config and sent to that provider's base URL, which may be a third-party relay. The extractor now skips any key matching the same credential-pattern matcher the Claude extractor already uses, and the frontend snippet validator was aligned so a hand-edited snippet cannot put a key straight back. Because a Gemini snippet is never re-extracted once it exists, a one-time startup cleanup also scrubs credentials that already leaked — from the snippet, from every provider they were merged into, and from `~/.gemini/.env`, matching by key *and* value so a provider's own same-named key with a different value survives. (#5811)
- **Skill Repository Install Hardening**: Installing or browsing skills from a GitHub repository could write files outside the intended directory: archive entries were joined onto the destination path without normalisation (zip-slip), and repository coordinates were never validated, so a branch like `../../../releases/download/v1/evil` retargeted the download at an arbitrary release asset — and since skill repositories can arrive via an untrusted `ccswitch://` deeplink and are enabled by default, merely opening the Skills panel could trigger the download. Skill `directory` values from restored backups, sync snapshots, and import-from-apps were likewise joined raw, letting uninstall `remove_dir_all` outside the managed skills directory. Every sink now validates the directory name, repository owner/name/branch are whitelisted at the single download convergence point, and extraction is capped (10,000 entries, 512 MB written, 128 MB download, 4 KB symlink targets, self-referential symlinks rejected), with the new errors localized in all four languages. (#5811)
- **Deep-Link Import Confirmations Show the Whole Payload (Credentials Masked) and Flag Risky Values**: The `ccswitch://` MCP import confirmation previously rendered a single truncated `Command:` line and showed neither `args`, `url`, nor `env` — so a link carrying `command: "sh"` with `args: ["-c", "curl …|sh"]` and an `LD_PRELOAD` variable displayed as a harmless `sh`, yet was written to the live MCP files on confirm. The dialog now renders command, each argument, URL, and env vars on separate lines that wrap instead of truncating, so nothing is clipped out of view (env values whose name contains TOKEN, KEY, SECRET, or PASSWORD are shown masked, as a prefix plus asterisks), and highlights values that warrant a second look: shell interpreters invoked with inline-command flags, env vars that change how a process loads code (`LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PATH`, proxy vars), and endpoints pointing at loopback, private-range, or cloud-metadata addresses. The markers are advisory and never block an import — a local Ollama endpoint is ordinary usage. The provider confirmation gains the same treatment, and the "will be written immediately" warning is now shown unconditionally instead of being gated on a link-controlled field.
- **Usage Scripts From Deep Links Arrive Disabled and Their Code Is Shown**: A usage-query script imported through a deep link is JavaScript that runs on every usage query, and it was previously possible to acquire one without ever seeing it: the backend treated the mere presence of code as a decision to enable it, and the dialog showed only an Enabled/Disabled badge. Scripts now default to disabled — a link must explicitly carry `usageEnabled=true` — and the confirmation displays the complete decoded script in a scrollable code block with a warning that it will execute once enabled. Decoding failures fall back to displaying the raw payload, so a malformed script can never read as "there is no script".
- **URL-Safe Base64 Payloads Could Blank the Confirmation Dialog Entirely**: The two entries above make the confirmation show more; this one is about the confirmation showing *nothing*. The backend accepts four Base64 variants including the URL-safe alphabet (RFC 4648 §5), while the frontend's `atob` accepts only the standard one and, on failure, returned its input unchanged instead of signalling an error — so for the same payload the backend decoded and imported successfully while the frontend held an undecodable string. Usage scripts and system prompts rendered as opaque Base64, and MCP configs were worse: `JSON.parse` threw, the component swallowed it, and the dialog rendered **"0 servers" with an empty list while the backend wrote the real entry into the live MCP files**. Substituting a single `/` for `_` in the payload was enough — the dialog went blank, the import stayed fully functional, and the complete-payload display added above was defeated along with it. The frontend decoder now normalises the URL-safe alphabet before decoding, so the confirmation always matches what will be imported, and the shared decoder gained its first unit tests — with in-test preconditions asserting each sample really exercises the URL-safe path rather than happening to encode identically under both alphabets. Affected every release from v3.8.0 onward; see Upgrade notes for what to check.
- **SQL Import Rejects Statements That Reach Outside the Import Database**: Importing a database backup validated only the file's header comment and then handed the entire text to `execute_batch`, so a crafted backup could `ATTACH DATABASE` and create a SQLite file anywhere the user can write — a side effect that landed even when the import as a whole failed, and one reachable through WebDAV/S3 sync snapshots too. A SQLite authorizer is now installed for the duration of the external batch only, denying `ATTACH`/`DETACH`, `VACUUM`, virtual-table creation, and any action SQLite reports as unknown (fail-closed), with PRAGMAs limited to the two the exporter actually emits.
- **Prototype Pollution in Common-Config Snippet Handling**: The three walkers that apply, remove, and compare common-config snippets all followed `__proto__` into the global `Object.prototype`, so a malicious snippet — reachable via WebDAV/S3 sync, since the `settings` table is overwritten by whatever the remote sends — could write attacker-chosen values onto the global prototype the moment a provider form was opened. All three walkers now skip `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`; the "common config applied" comparison also now requires own properties, fixing a visible quirk where `{"__proto__":{}}` counted as a subset of every config.
- **Command Substitution via Project Directory Names on Terminal Launch**: Resuming a session in an external terminal built the `cd` line with double-quote escaping, which stops spaces but not `$(…)`, backticks, or `$VAR` — and the value is the real project path recorded in the CLI's session history, which may legitimately contain those characters. Any project folder named that way executed the embedded command in the user's terminal on Resume. The three launchers that build a shell line — Terminal.app, iTerm, and kitty — now use POSIX single-quote escaping, where nothing expands, including through the AppleScript quoting layer; Ghostty, WezTerm/Kaku, and Alacritty were already safe because they pass the directory as its own argument.
- **GrokBuild Credential Resolution No Longer Substitutes Environment Secrets**: GrokBuild credential extraction fell back to the process-wide `XAI_API_KEY` whenever the configured `env_key` variable was unset, silently sending a different account's key to whatever base URL the config pointed at; credentials now come only from an explicit inline `api_key` or the exact variable named by `env_key`. Deep-link import no longer resolves environment variables into a plaintext `api_key`, and a link whose only credential is an `env_key` name is rejected with a message to add the provider manually. As a side effect, base-URL resolution was decoupled from credential resolution, fixing a macOS quirk where a missing credential also blanked the base URL shown in the UI and used by usage scripts. (#5811)

### Docs

- **Claude Code GPT Routing Guide Now in English and Japanese**: The local-routing guide for running GPT-family models inside Claude Code, previously Chinese-only, is now fully ported to English and Japanese, covering both integration paths end to end (a third-party OpenAI Responses gateway with an API key, and a ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription via the Codex device-code OAuth flow). Both routing guides were retitled to name the models they are about — "Using GPT Models in Claude Code with CC Switch" and "Using Claude Models in Codex with CC Switch" — and every cross-link, including the v3.18.0 release notes in all three languages, now points readers at their own-language copy.
- **Corrected the Deep-Link `usageEnabled` Default in the User Manual**: The deep-link reference in all three user manuals claimed `usageEnabled` defaults to `true`; it actually defaults to `false`, matching the importer. The manuals now state the correct default and document that the script body is shown in full before import and stays disabled until explicitly enabled.
- **Security Policy Documents the Threat Model and Reporting Scope**: `SECURITY.md` gained a bilingual threat model with explicit in-scope and out-of-scope lists, so reports are triaged by who controls the input rather than which API a value eventually reaches: the bundled WebView renderer is declared a trusted component (with the four independently checkable facts backing that and the triggers that would void it), while deep-link payloads, WebDAV/S3 restore data, imported files, upstream API responses, and inbound requests to the local proxy are all named as untrusted and in scope. The same reasoning is recorded as a doc comment on the terminal-launch command.

### Internal

- **Release Assets Mirrored to Cloudflare R2 for ccswitch.io Downloads**: Release automation mirrors every installer to an R2 bucket behind `dl.ccswitch.io` and generates the manifest the ccswitch.io download page consumes — per-file SHA-256 checksums, sizes, and the release's real publish date — with immutable caching for versioned assets, a five-minute TTL on the root manifest, and pruning beyond the five most recent versions. Forks without the R2 credentials skip the sync entirely.
- **Skill ZIP Extraction Tests No Longer Hijack TMPDIR**: Two cleanup-guard tests pointed the process-global `TMPDIR` at a scratch directory and asserted it ended up empty, so any concurrently running test that created a temp directory randomly failed the assertion on Ubuntu and macOS CI. The extraction now takes its temp base explicitly through a test seam and the tests use a private directory; the shipped code path is unchanged.

### Upgrade notes

- No database schema migration in this release — `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays at 16.
- On first launch after upgrading, a one-time Gemini common-config cleanup runs before the usual config extraction. Some Gemini providers may afterwards report a missing API key: entries are removed by credential-style key name plus exact value match, so this is usually another provider's credential that leaked through the shared snippet (the provider's own original value was overwritten when the leak occurred and cannot be recovered) — but a key you intentionally reused across several Gemini providers is removed from all of them as well. Either way, rotate and re-enter the key: treat anything that sat in the shared Gemini snippet as exposed. An audit record listing the removed key names and affected provider ids — never the values — is stored in the `settings` table under `gemini_common_config_scrub_audit_v1`.
- If you have ever imported an MCP server from a `ccswitch://` link, it is worth auditing once. Before this release the MCP import confirmation could fail to show what it was about to write: arguments and env vars were not rendered at all (`command: "sh"` with `args: ["-c", …]` displayed as a harmless `sh`), and a URL-safe Base64 payload made the whole list render as "0 servers" — while the backend wrote the real entry to the live MCP files in both cases. Both defects affected **every release from v3.8.0 onward** and are fixed here. Exploitation required opening an attacker-supplied link and confirming the import, so most users are unaffected; if you did open an MCP import link from a source you do not fully trust, review the entries in the MCP panel, or directly in `~/.claude.json` under `mcpServers` (Codex: `mcp_servers` in `~/.codex/config.toml`), and confirm you recognise each one — MCP servers are executed as subprocesses the next time the CLI starts.
- Deep links carrying a usage-query script now import it disabled unless the link explicitly sets `usageEnabled=true`. Links that relied on auto-enablement (for example some partner one-click setup links) will import the script but leave usage querying off — enable it in the provider editor after reviewing the code.
- The new default models apply only to newly added providers — providers already saved keep the model IDs they were created with. For Claude Desktop, the current opus route ID advances to `claude-opus-5` with `claude-opus-4-8` moving into the legacy slot, so opus route IDs stored in existing configs still resolve through the compatibility alias.
- New built-in pricing rows (`claude-opus-5`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `grok-4.5-build`) are appended insert-if-absent on next launch — this seeding never overwrites a price you edited. A `~/.cc-switch/model-pricing.json` file is created (empty) to hold manual overrides and deletions made from this version onward — earlier price edits are not migrated into it, so re-save any you want protected against a database rebuild. Automatic models.dev sync stays off until you enable it; once enabled, it is the one path that does overwrite matching prices, built-in and hand-edited alike.
- GrokBuild providers that relied on the implicit `XAI_API_KEY` environment fallback now need an explicit `api_key` or a correctly named `env_key`.
- Grok Build official-mode usage appears with a deliberate delay of roughly ten minutes plus one sync cycle, so events can be checked against proxy-recorded rows; if routed and official usage alternate within that window, some official-mode turns are skipped rather than risk double counting. Grok Build rows already over-priced by the old cost backfill keep their inflated value — the backfill never revises an existing positive cost.
- The updater endpoint list ships inside the app binary, so existing installations keep checking GitHub until they have updated once to a build containing this change; from then on the `dl.ccswitch.io` mirror is preferred with GitHub as fallback.
- Sponsor providers you already created keep the base URL stored in the database, so they still target the old domains. To move onto a migrated domain, edit the provider's address by hand or re-create it from the refreshed preset.

## [3.18.0] - 2026-07-21

Development since v3.17.0 is headlined by Grok Build joining as the eighth managed app — full provider switching, proxy takeover on its own route namespace, MCP/Skills/prompts sync, a curated preset list, and a Grok Official entry with official-login import (schema v14/v15) — and by xAI Grok account sign-in over an OAuth device flow for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Codex, including a strict-gateway compatibility layer that lets codex 0.142+ drive a Grok subscription over native Responses. A usage-accounting repair wave fixes the v3.17.0 fork/sub-agent double count with a one-time automatic rebuild (schema v16) plus a manual rebuild action, makes proxy usage logging idempotent, and stops the usage page freezing during large imports. Diagnostics mature: logs persist across restarts under size rotation, every log egress redacts secrets, and renderer crashes are captured to disk behind an error boundary with a reload screen. The Codex conversion layer gets four correctness fixes — tool schemas normalized to object type, reasoning attached forward across turns, streamed tool-call identity and order preserved, and parser-required catalog fields backfilled so codex 0.144.5+ starts — while managed-OAuth providers are now reliably flagged as routing-required and Windows provider switches no longer flash a console window or freeze the UI. Rounded out by Kimi K3 presets and pricing, corrected OpenClaw preset costs, SudoCode.us restored beside SudoCode.chat, sponsor-grouped preset ordering, first-run tray language detection, and permanently deletable default Skill repositories.

### Added

- **Grok Build Becomes the Eighth Managed App**: xAI's Grok CLI ("Grok Build", live config `~/.grok/config.toml`) is now a first-class managed app alongside Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes: full provider add/import/switch (with a "restart Grok Build to apply" toast), app visibility and config-directory override settings, session manager and usage dashboard coverage, prompts with first-launch auto-import, deep-link (`ccswitch://`) provider import, and proxy takeover with its own `/grokbuild/v1/responses` route namespace, failover queue, and per-app proxy settings row — it reuses the Codex Responses forwarding path but never shares Codex's provider namespace or circuit-breaker state. MCP servers sync bidirectionally into Grok's `[mcp_servers]` table with the dialect differences handled (Grok infers transport from `command`/`url` and uses `headers`, so exports strip the explicit `type` and rename `http_headers` to `headers`, while imports infer the transport back), and Skills gain a Grok Build enable flag. Instead of borrowing the Codex preset list (an early cut leaked China-official direct providers and Codex default models into the Grok form), Grok Build ships its own curated preset module: aggregators and relays that actually carry Grok models, default model normalized to `grok-4.5` (`x-ai/grok-4.5` on namespaced routers), with no `cn_official` category. The tools panel installs Grok via the official xAI installer (`x.ai/cli/install.sh` / `install.ps1`) with npm `@xai-official/grok` as fallback; installs detected as native (launcher in `~/.grok/bin` or `$GROK_BIN_DIR`, real target under `~/.grok/downloads/grok-*`) self-update via `grok update`, while npm installs keep npm-anchored updates — the self-update is gated on positive native detection so it can never mutate a different install. Localized in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). (#5453)
- **Grok Official Provider With Official-Login Import**: A "Grok Official" entry lets Grok Build fall back to the CLI's own built-in xAI OAuth login: selecting it hides the connection fields and writes an empty `~/.grok/config.toml`, and CC Switch never stores or touches those credentials. Live-config reads, backups, and official-state writes now use syntax-only TOML validation, so an official-login (empty) config round-trips instead of failing; importing the live config while Grok is in official login state yields "Grok Official set as current" instead of an error, matching Codex behavior. Official-state detection is deliberately wired only into the manual import command — the startup auto-importer still rejects official-state configs, so a deleted Grok Official entry is never resurrected on launch. Proxy takeover of an official-login Grok config is skipped automatically and rejected with a clear message on the manual path, consistent with the existing ban on proxying official providers.
- **Sign In With Your xAI Grok Account (OAuth) in Claude Code and Claude Desktop**: New "xAI (Grok)" presets for Claude Code and Claude Desktop authenticate with an OAuth device-code login instead of an API key, routing requests through the local proxy which transforms Anthropic Messages traffic to the xAI Responses API and injects the access token per request (default model `grok-4.5` on every role; the Claude Desktop preset maps the branded `claude-*` role IDs to `grok-4.5` upstream so it passes Desktop's third-party model validation). A new xAI section in Settings → OAuth Auth Center handles device-code login (user code with copy button, verification link, waiting/cancel/retry), multiple accounts with a default-account picker, per-account removal, and re-auth badges — accounts whose refresh token was revoked stay visible as "expired" instead of disappearing, and auth status refetches every 15 s so server-side revocation surfaces on its own. The integration is pinned closed: upstream is always `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses` in Responses format regardless of what the editable endpoint/format fields say, OAuth endpoints are resolved via OIDC discovery but validated to `auth.x.ai` over https only, refresh tokens live in `~/.cc-switch/xai_oauth_auth.json` (`0600` on Unix; access tokens are memory-only), and OAuth error bodies are never embedded in error messages or logs. `grok-4.5` is also seeded into the built-in pricing table ($2 input / $6 output / $0.50 cache-read per 1M tokens), fixing the $0 cost the dashboard would otherwise record; existing databases pick the row up automatically on next launch. Localized in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). See the upgrade notes for the client-identity disclosure.
- **xAI (Grok) Codex Presets: OAuth Managed and Native-Responses API Key**: Codex gains two ways to talk to xAI directly. The "xAI (Grok) OAuth" managed preset drives Codex against a Grok subscription through the local proxy — the form hides the key/endpoint/format fields and shows the account picker, "fetch models" uses the signed-in account, and the provider is pinned to native Responses with the base URL and per-request token enforced by the proxy (edited base URLs or formats are ignored, so the managed route cannot be redirected). Because codex 0.142+ emits ChatGPT-backend-private shapes that xAI's strict parser rejects (`type:"namespace"` tool declarations → 422, plus private fields like `prompt_cache_retention`, `safety_identifier`, `external_web_access`, the `additional_tools` carrier, and grok-4.5-unsupported sampling knobs), the OAuth route gets a compatibility layer on the native passthrough: namespace tools are flattened to top-level function tools (using the same sha256-truncated naming as the Chat path) and restored to namespaced form in both streaming and non-streaming responses, and unsupported fields are stripped — all deterministic field-removal/structural lifts, never semantic rewrites, so prompt-cache prefixes stay stable. The layer is gated exclusively on the xAI OAuth provider type: no other provider's traffic is touched, including the second new preset, a plain "xAI (Grok)" API-key preset (native Responses against `api.x.ai/v1` with a 500K-context `grok-4.5` catalog entry) that does not receive these xAI-specific compatibility transforms — API-key users on codex 0.142+ can still hit xAI's strict parser, and the OAuth preset is the fully-compatible path. xAI OAuth token failures are classified non-retryable so failover never silently moves a conversation onto a different Grok account.
- **Renderer Crash Capture With On-Disk Reports and a Reload Screen**: A React error boundary now wraps the UI (including the database-recovery screen), so a renderer crash shows a "Something went wrong in the interface" card with a Reload button instead of a blank white window, and global `error`/`unhandledrejection` handlers persist renderer errors to disk via the new `log:default` capability — previously a JS crash left zero on-disk evidence. Everything logged from the frontend passes two redaction layers: a structured serializer that redacts by sensitive property name (normalized so `tokens`/`apiKeys`/`credentials` variants all match, hiding the entire value including nested objects) and by value shape (token prefixes, PEM headers, high-entropy opaque strings), then a single text egress (`redactFrontendLogText`) whose ordered regex chain covers URL query values and credentials, auth headers and schemes, and named secret containers even in double-encoded JSON. JSON that arrives as a string is re-parsed and redacted structurally, and oversized structured input is dropped entirely rather than truncated — a truncated JSON string would fall back to the weaker text regexes and could leak. The settings toggles were also relabeled to say what they actually control: "Application Diagnostic Logs" (cc-switch.log) versus the proxy's "Record Request Usage" (the stats database, which never was a text log). Localized in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW).
- **"Rebuild Codex Usage" Maintenance Action**: The usage dashboard's maintenance section gains a "Rebuild Codex Usage" button that backs up the database, wipes only `codex_session`-sourced detail rows, their `_codex_session` daily rollups, and the Codex sync cursors, then re-imports every rollout file from scratch with the corrected parser — the recovery path for databases already inflated by the fork double-count bug below, and the retry path for deferred fork files whose parent log has since been restored. The manual rebuild fails hard when the pre-rebuild backup cannot be written (unlike the automatic migration variant, which only warns, since blocking startup on an unwritable backup directory would leave the app unable to launch after upgrade), holds the session-sync lock across the whole backup → reset → reimport sequence so the 60-second background sync cannot interleave with the wipe, and always sends exactly one frontend refresh notification on completion — including when the reimport returns zero rows or fails after the reset — so the dashboard never keeps showing pre-reset numbers (`finish_codex_rebuild` in `commands/usage.rs`, pinned by two regression tests). Cursor deletion matches rollout paths purely by shape (`rollout-{uuid}` filename under a `sessions`/`archived_sessions` segment), so cursors recorded under an old `CODEX_HOME` are still cleaned. Localized in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW).
- **Session Import Observability: Deferred Files and Suspected Duplicates**: Session sync results now report `filesScanned`, `deferredFiles` — fork rollouts whose parent log is missing or whose parent markers conflict, held back without writing a cursor so a later sync or manual rebuild retries them, instead of being imported on a guess — and `suspectedDuplicates`, backed by a post-insert probe that checks each imported row for a pre-existing same-fingerprint row (via the `idx_request_logs_dedup_lookup_expr` expression index) and logs a warning per hit, so any future regression of the double-count bug announces itself in the logs instead of silently inflating totals.
- **Kimi K3 in Presets and Built-In Pricing**: The Kimi open-platform presets for Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw, and OpenCode gain the Kimi K3 model (1M context window), appended after K2.7 Code so existing default-model behavior is unchanged, and the built-in pricing table gains `kimi-k3` at the official list price ($3 input / $15 output / $0.30 cache-read per 1M tokens) plus a bare `k3` alias — the Kimi For Coding subscription reports its model under the short id `k3`, which would otherwise match no pricing row (same precedent as the existing `hunyuan-hy3`/`hy3` pair). Existing databases pick both rows up automatically on next launch without touching user-edited pricing.
- **SudoCode.us Restored Alongside SudoCode.chat**: The two unrelated companies sharing the "SudoCode" name are now separate presets: the sponsor is renamed "SudoCode.chat", and the legacy "SudoCode.us" (which an earlier release had replaced in place) returns with its original endpoints and models, its own icon, and a distinct Hermes slug so both can coexist in the additive `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Counting the new Grok Build preset list, SudoCode.chat now ships in seven apps and SudoCode.us in all eight.

### Changed

- **Diagnostic Logs Persist Across Restarts, Are Size-Rotated, and Never Record Secrets**: `cc-switch.log` is no longer wiped on every startup — the log that explained a crash used to be gone by the time the app reopened — and instead rotates at 20 MB with 4 archives kept (~100 MB cap, versus a single 1 GB file before); `crash.log`, previously unbounded, rotates at 5 MB with 2 archives, with the size-check/rotate/append sequence under one lock so concurrent panics cannot lose an archive. Because persistent logs make verbatim secrets a real exposure (users attach these files to public issues), every backend log egress was scrubbed in the same change: upstream URLs are logged with userinfo, query, and fragment stripped (origin-only when no known secret is available to scrub, since a credential could be embedded in the path), request and response bodies are never logged — replaced by byte counts, a short hash, or a safe classification (`sse`/`html`/`json-like`/`binary-or-encoded`/…) that preserves the transform-debugging signal without the content — response headers go through an allowlist (unlisted headers log name-only), the exact secret values in use (API key, access token) are scrubbed out of any logged URL that carries them, and MCP custom-field values are omitted. The log plugin also registers earlier (so updater/startup failures are diagnosable), the persisted log level applies as soon as the database opens and fails closed to Info, and the "Enable Diagnostic Logs" switch now gates frontend-originated log writes too. Pre-upgrade log files are not retroactively scrubbed — see upgrade notes.
- **Preset Picker Groups Sponsors and Alphabetizes the Rest**: The picker's default ordering now has four tiers — official first, then the prime partner, then sponsor presets (in the same order as the README sponsor table, which the preset files were physically reordered to match), then all remaining presets sorted alphabetically by display name instead of file order. An entry matching multiple tiers lands only in the earliest, so nothing is listed twice.
- **Preset "Get API Key" Links Updated to Current Referral URLs**: The key-application links on the RunAPI, ClaudeCN, ZetaAPI, and APINebula presets now open each provider's current registration/referral page (ClaudeCN also moved domains, claudecn.top → claudecn.ai). Referral tags remain confined to these links and the README — website links and API endpoints stay untouched.

### Fixed

- **Codex Fork/Sub-Agent Rollouts No Longer Import Replayed Parent History**: Fixes the v3.17.0 usage inflation where forking a Codex task or spawning a sub-agent in copy mode re-counted the parent conversation's token history as new usage — reports showed single days jumping by billions of tokens, duplicated parent/child rows that were byte-identical, and empty forks carrying usage they never consumed. Fork and sub-agent rollout files begin by replaying the parent thread's history, and the previous parser located the takeover boundary heuristically (first `thread_settings_applied` event, object-shaped `subagent` source markers): the boundary landed too early when the parent's own settings changes appeared in the replay, and was missed entirely for the current string-shaped source format, importing the whole replayed parent history. The parser now identifies a fork only by explicit parent identity — `forked_from_id` on the child's `session_meta` or `source.subagent.thread_spawn.parent_thread_id`, with a conflict between the two deferring the file — anchors each thread's identity to the rollout filename UUID, loads the parent rollout's own pre-fork token-count sequence, and strips the child's replayed prefix by aligning token signatures against it, so replayed events only restore the cumulative baseline and are never inserted as rows. Sub-agent logs that carry no replayed history are now counted as live usage, fixing the opposite-direction undercount where real sub-agent consumption was skipped as suspected replay. (#5335, #5433, #5381)
- **Proxy Usage Logging Is Now Idempotent With Stable Response-Scoped Keys**: When a terminal usage event carried no message id — the norm for Codex `/responses` traffic through the local proxy — the dedup key fell back to a random UUID, so every retry or replay of the same upstream response minted a fresh key and `INSERT OR REPLACE` stacked a new row each time; one reporter's database held the same usage combination 2,078 times. The parser now derives the key from the response envelope itself — the Codex `response.completed` event's `response.id` (`response.created` ids are discarded), Chat Completions `chatcmpl` ids, and the Gemini `responseId` — scoped as `session:{app_type}:{provider_id}:{id}` so the same response replayed against a different provider during failover still bills once per provider without cross-provider collisions (Claude keeps the bare `session:{id}` shape so proxy rows continue to converge with session-log imports). When no envelope id exists at all, the fallback is a deterministic SHA-256 over the response's usage semantics rather than a random UUID — an identical replay must collide into the same key for dedup to work — and the final database write is a guarded insert-if-absent within the dedup window instead of an unconditional REPLACE. (#5496)
- **Usage Page No Longer Freezes During Large Session Imports**: Opening the usage page while a big import ran could lock up the UI: every inserted row fired a refresh notification, each notification made the frontend re-run all ~10 usage queries, and those queries contended with the importer for the single database connection while it parsed rollout files tens of megabytes large line by line — on duplicate-inflated databases the row storm compounded all three. Session sync now notifies the frontend once per completed sync pass instead of once per row, all session importers are serialized behind a single-flight lock (a manual "sync now" queues behind the running pass instead of racing it), the blocking parse work runs on a dedicated blocking thread so it no longer starves the async runtime driving the UI's commands, and the 60-second background tick skips missed runs instead of bursting to catch up.
- **Codex 0.144.5+ No Longer Fails to Start on CC Switch-Generated Model Catalogs**: codex ≥ 0.144.5 parses external model catalogs strictly and rejects the whole file when an entry is missing `supports_reasoning_summaries` — so both the Codex CLI and desktop app failed to launch, and deleting the generated catalog didn't help because any provider save regenerated it the same way. The root cause is that CC Switch clones its catalog template from the machine-shared `models_cache.json`, whose field set is whatever the last-writing codex process produced — a coexisting older codex build kept rewriting the cache without the field the newer parser requires. Generated catalogs now backfill parser-required fields from the bundled static template, only when absent (dynamic values always win), and deliberately do not backfill optional capability fields whose "missing = parser default" semantics must survive.
- **Windows: No More Console Flash or UI Freeze When Switching Providers**: Switching providers or toggling takeover on Windows flashed a transient console window and froze the UI for up to ~2 seconds. Three causes, three fixes: the `codex debug models --bundled` probe launches `codex.cmd` through `cmd.exe`, which in a GUI-subsystem app spawns its own console — the child process is now created with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`; the model-catalog template was regenerated on every switch — it is now cached process-wide after the first successful load (failures stay retryable so a bad first probe cannot poison the cache), so the Codex CLI starts at most once per app run; and `switch_provider` was a synchronous command running on the main thread — it is now async with the real work on a blocking thread, still serialized by the per-app switch lock. The freeze fix benefits all platforms; the console-flash fix is Windows-specific.
- **Codex Tool Schemas With Null, Missing, or Union Parameter Types Are Accepted by Strict Upstreams**: Built-in Codex tools such as `codex_app__automation_update` declare `parameters: null` (or `type: null`), which strict OpenAI-compatible upstreams like DeepSeek reject with a 400 for the entire request, killing tool-using sessions routed through the proxy. The Responses→Chat bridge now normalizes every tool's parameters to a `type:"object"` schema — null or missing parameters (including the nested-form missing case) become `{"type":"object","properties":{}}`, a non-object `type` (including `type: null`) is coerced to `"object"` in place, and top-level `oneOf` union schemas get a root `type:"object"` added while their branches are preserved untouched. The same object-type guarantee was extended to the Codex→Anthropic tool path's `input_schema`. Existing `properties`/`required` are never dropped. (#4706, #5315; issues #4705, #4783)
- **Reasoning Models Keep Their Thinking Across Multi-Turn Codex Chat Conversations**: With a reasoning model (e.g. kimi-k2-thinking) behind the proxy's Responses→Chat bridge, multi-turn history mangled the thinking: each turn's `reasoning` item was glued onto the tail of the _previous_ assistant message, leaving the following assistant turn with no `reasoning_content` — models would visibly break off mid-conversation. Responses semantics place reasoning _before_ the message it belongs to, so the bridge now attaches reasoning forward to the assistant message or tool call that follows it; genuine trailing reasoning back-attaches only at the true tail (end of input, or a turn boundary such as an incoming user message — where it was previously silently discarded), appending to any embedded reasoning already present, and pending reasoning is always consumed at boundaries so it can never leak across a user turn into a later assistant message. (#5508)
- **Streamed Parallel Tool Calls Keep Their IDs and Their Order**: Two bugs in the Chat→Responses streaming bridge corrupted parallel tool calls from upstreams that split identity across chunks: a continuation delta carrying an empty `id` overwrote the real `call_id` (the Codex client then saw `call_id:""` and couldn't match tool results to calls), and tool calls were emitted the moment they individually became ready, so a later index whose name arrived early could jump ahead of an earlier one — reordering parallel calls. Empty ids are now ignored, and emission goes through a consecutive-index gate that releases tool calls strictly in Chat `index` order, waiting on any not-yet-identified earlier index; no fake call id is ever synthesized mid-stream (only as a last resort at stream finalization, which also skips nameless calls defensively and still emits sparse indexes). (#5310)
- **Managed-OAuth Providers Are Reliably Flagged as Needing Local Routing**: The "needs routing" badge and switch-time warning were derived from the provider's API format, which is the wrong signal for managed-OAuth providers (Copilot, Codex OAuth, xAI) whose credential is injected by the proxy regardless of upstream format — a managed provider on a native format got no warning and failed silently without takeover. Routing need is now decided by a single shared predicate: official providers never need routing, managed-OAuth providers always do, and format-based rules apply only to the remaining cases per app. The switch-time gate also checks the right readiness signal per app: per-app takeover for most apps (the old gate looked only at a global proxy-running flag, missing the case where the proxy runs but the current app is not taken over), while Claude Desktop keeps watching the proxy process itself — the backend's takeover status has no Claude Desktop field, so a uniform per-app gate would have left Desktop warning forever. Claude Desktop provider forms now force proxy mode and lock the model-mapping toggle for every managed-OAuth type, not just xAI. Localized in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW).
- **Tool Updates Work When Node Lives in nvm/fnm/mise Under a GUI Launch**: Anchored npm update and repair commands invoked npm by absolute path, but npm's launcher resolves `node` via its `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang against PATH — and a GUI-launched app inherits only the system PATH, not the user's version-manager directories, so updates silently failed for tools installed via nvm/fnm/mise. Every anchored npm invocation now prefixes PATH with npm's own sibling `bin` directory, so both npm and its shebang resolve to the same Node install; the Codex self-repair (uninstall + reinstall) path is covered too.
- **Deleted Default Skill Repositories Stay Deleted**: Default Skill repositories were re-seeded on every startup by a "supplement missing defaults" pass, so a default repo the user deleted silently returned on the next launch. Seeding is now one-time per database, tracked by a settings flag; databases that already contain repositories at upgrade time get the flag set without any re-seeding, so existing selections are untouched. (#5356)
- **First-Run Tray Language Follows the System Locale**: Before any language was chosen in settings, the tray menu was hardcoded to Simplified Chinese even on English/Japanese/Traditional-Chinese systems where the main UI correctly followed the OS locale — tray and UI disagreed until the user switched language once. The tray now derives its first-run language from the OS locale with the same precedence rules as the frontend (including `zh-TW`/`zh-HK`/`zh-Hant` → Traditional Chinese); an explicitly chosen language always wins, and unreadable locales fall back to Chinese as before. (#4355)
- **Failed Live-Config Imports Show the Real Error and Refresh the List**: Every failed "import from live config" produced an empty error toast, because Tauri's `invoke` rejects with the backend's error _string_ while the handler read `.message` off it; the actual backend message is now shown (with a localized generic fallback), and the provider list is refreshed even on failure so side effects committed before the error are visible immediately.
- **OpenClaw Preset Model Costs Corrected to Official List Prices**: Fifteen OpenClaw preset entries carried cost values in the wrong unit or unconverted currency — the `cost` field is USD per million tokens, but e.g. `glm-5.1` was listed at `0.001/0.001` (≈1000× undervalued, so its usage showed near-zero cost) while `deepseek-v4-pro` carried unconverted CNY values (overvalued). All entries now carry official list prices in $/M; subscription-plan and free-tier endpoints deliberately show list prices too, so plan users see the standard value of their usage. Providers created from these presets going forward get the corrected values; previously added providers keep the config they were created with.
- **AiHubMix Icon on the Codex Preset**: The Codex app's AiHubMix preset was the only one missing its brand icon fields and rendered a generic icon; it now matches the other apps.
- **Two Missing Locale Keys Backfilled in All Four Locales**: The Codex "needs routing because it uses Anthropic Messages format" toast rendered its reason fragment in Chinese inside an otherwise-localized sentence because `proxyReasonAnthropicMessages` existed in no locale file, and the provider-form key-status loading label had shipped only as a hardcoded default since April; both now exist in zh/en/ja/zh-TW.

### Docs

- **Codex + Claude Local Routing Guide (Three Languages)**: New guide in Chinese, English, and Japanese on pointing Codex at a Claude-family `/v1/messages` gateway via the native Anthropic Messages upstream format introduced in v3.17.0, with screenshots; the v3.17.0 release notes now link to it.
- **Claude Code via Codex Providers Guide (Chinese)**: New Chinese guide on using Responses-speaking providers (a gateway API key, or a ChatGPT subscription's Codex service) from Claude Code: Claude Code keeps talking Anthropic Messages to the local `/v1/messages` route, and the proxy converts each request to the upstream's Responses protocol. With screenshots.
- **README Sponsor Updates**: SubRouter added as a sponsor across the four README languages; the pinned Kimi sponsor copy refreshed to K3 with banners served from the Moonshot CDN; RunAPI benefit copy refreshed and sponsor rows reordered to match the in-app preset order.

### Internal

- **Backend CI Now Covers Linux, Windows, and macOS**: Backend checks previously ran only on Ubuntu, so Windows/macOS-gated code paths were never compiled or tested in CI — the matrix now spans all three platforms, with the platform-gated tests repaired to pass everywhere (TOML literal-string path escapes, stale anchored-update expectations, and skill tests honoring the test home-directory override). No shipped behavior changes. (#5138)

### Upgrade notes

- Upgrading from v3.17.0 runs three schema migrations (v13 → v16): v14 rebuilds the `proxy_config` table to admit Grok Build (existing per-app proxy settings are carried over and a `grokbuild` row is added), v15 adds Grok Build enablement columns to the MCP-server and Skills tables, and v16 triggers the Codex usage rebuild described next.
- Schema v16 performs a one-time automatic rebuild of Codex session usage on first launch after upgrading: the database is backed up under `backups/`, `codex_session` data and cursors are reset, and the normal startup sync re-imports everything with the corrected parser. Expect seconds for typical data; the heaviest dataset measured (1,801 rollout files / 1.5 GB) took about 65 seconds. Later launches are incremental as before.
- The rebuild recomputes usage from the rollout JSONL files, so history whose source log was already deleted cannot be reconstructed.
- Fork files whose parent rollout is missing are deferred and reported instead of guessed; restoring the parent log and running “Rebuild Codex Usage” imports them later.
- Historical proxy-source duplicate rows are permanently retained — the migration rebuilds only session-sourced data, and no cleanup pass for past proxy inflation exists; the idempotent logger prevents new duplicates from this point on.
- The xAI Grok OAuth integration reuses the official Grok CLI's public OAuth client identity and scopes (`client_id b1a00492-073a-47ea-816f-4c329264a828`, scope including `grok-cli:access`) rather than a CC Switch-registered application. xAI may not support this use, and it could lead to account restriction or suspension — use at your own risk. The feature is entirely opt-in; nothing changes unless you add an xAI provider. On first login it creates `~/.cc-switch/xai_oauth_auth.json` (refresh tokens only, `0600` on Unix; access tokens are held in memory) and contacts `auth.x.ai` and `api.x.ai` through the configured outbound proxy, with no local callback port.
- Diagnostic logs are no longer cleared at startup and now persist across restarts (up to ~100 MB of rotated runtime logs plus ~15 MB of crash logs). Log files written by earlier versions are not retroactively scrubbed and may contain API keys, tokens, or URLs with credentials — review pre-upgrade logs before sharing them publicly.
- Installing or reinstalling Grok Build now prefers the official xAI installer, fetching `x.ai/cli/install.sh` (or `install.ps1` on Windows) at install time, with npm as fallback; existing npm installs keep updating via npm.
- New built-in pricing rows (`grok-4.5`, `kimi-k3`, `k3`) are appended automatically on next launch via insert-if-absent; user-edited pricing rows are never overwritten.

## [3.17.0] - 2026-07-13

Development since v3.16.5 is headlined by project profiles — named snapshots of provider/MCP/Skills/prompt state, switchable per scope from a new header switcher or the tray (schema v12) — and a deep Codex push: official ChatGPT-subscription sessions can now route through the local proxy takeover with a corrected client identity, gpt-5.6 lands across context-window injection and Sol/Terra/Luna pricing with 1.25× cache-write rates, and a native Anthropic Messages upstream joins the Codex format options. A proxy-correctness wave makes the Responses↔Anthropic bridges fail closed and round-trip reasoning/tool results losslessly, strengthens prompt-cache breakpoint injection, and fixes cache-write accounting across historical token semantics (schema v13); a config.toml hardening batch stops deleted MCP servers from resurrecting, fails MCP sync closed on unparseable files, extends switch-time common-config autosync to Codex, and moves the common-config merge to backend toml_edit. Usage tooling gains Zhipu team-plan quota queries, Codex sub-agent and free-plan accounting, and transient-failure retry, while Kimi For Coding's 256K window finally takes effect — rounded out by a Codex default-model form field, renamed-session titles, OpenCode form and live-sync fixes, and preset updates (SudoCode sponsorship, LongCat-2.0, GPT-5.6 defaults, Hunyuan Hy3 pricing).

### Added

- **Project Profiles for One-Click, Snapshot-Based Config Switching**: You can now save the current provider, MCP, Skills, and prompt state as a named "project" and re-apply it in one click from a new header switcher or the tray Projects submenu, so moving between per-project setups no longer means toggling each dimension by hand; it covers Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Codex (Claude Desktop's only cc-switch-managed dimension is its provider, so its snapshots capture just that and leave the other dimensions untouched on apply). Projects are global shared entities, but capture and switching are per scope — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Codex each keep their own `current_profile_id_<scope>` marker and only touch their own payload slots, so picking a project on the Codex tab never disturbs the Claude config (slots use `Option` to distinguish "never captured" from "captured empty", preventing cross-side accidental disable). Applying is best-effort: `ProfileService::apply` (in `services/profile.rs`) reuses the existing switch primitives — provider switch, then minimal MCP/Skills toggle diffs, then prompt enable — and any dangling reference or per-item failure becomes a warning instead of rolling back. Switching first autosaves the leaving project's current state for the active scope, so a project always holds the configuration you last left it in, which is why there is no manual "update snapshot from current state" button. Before applying, proxy takeover is unconditionally disabled per app in the scope, the frontend invalidates takeover status, and the proxy server is stopped when the switch leaves no takeovers active so Claude Desktop's local-route master toggle reads off. Backed by a new `profiles` table introduced by the v11→v12 schema migration, wired into `commands/profile.rs`, `database/dao/profiles.rs`, the tray, and `components/profiles/`, localized in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), with integration tests covering roundtrip, dangling refs, bidirectional autosave, and proxy-takeover teardown.
- **Setting to Show or Hide the Project Switcher on the Main Page**: The header project switcher can now be turned off from a new "Show project switcher" toggle under the Homepage Display section of Settings, for users who don't use projects and prefer a cleaner header. It defaults to on (`show_profile_switcher` / `showProfileSwitcher`) so existing users keep the current behavior, and disabling it only hides the header control on every tab — projects and the tray Projects submenu remain fully usable. Localized in all four locales.
- **Route Codex Official ChatGPT Sessions Through Proxy Takeover**: CC Switch can now route a Codex session authenticated with a ChatGPT subscription (native OAuth or API-key login, no stored API key) through the local proxy, so official-account traffic gets the same proxy routing, format conversion, and usage accounting that third-party providers already receive. The built-in `codex-official` "OpenAI Official" seed is restored if it was deleted (idempotent `ensure_codex_official_provider` command wired into the add-provider flow) and is now selectable during takeover from the provider panel and tray, with the provider card badge reading "Official Account Routing" while routing and "Codex Sign-in" otherwise; only that fixed seed qualifies (`is_codex_official_provider` / `official_provider_supports_proxy_takeover`, mirrored in the frontend `supportsOfficialProxyTakeover`), so copied UUID-based official entries stay blocked and still show "No Routing Support". Instead of writing an `OPENAI_API_KEY = PROXY_MANAGED` placeholder into `auth.json`, the official route projects a dedicated `cc-switch-official` `model_provider` into `config.toml` with `requires_openai_auth = true`, `wire_api = "responses"`, `supports_websockets = false`, and `base_url` pointing at the local proxy (`apply_codex_official_proxy_route`), so Codex forwards its own ChatGPT authorization to the proxy's `/responses` endpoint and the `codex-official` row never stores a credential (its `auth` stays `{}`). The forwarder passes the client's `Authorization` header through unchanged to the fixed first-party endpoint (`CHATGPT_CODEX_BASE_URL`, now shared by the Codex and Claude adapters), rejects a missing header or a stale `PROXY_MANAGED` placeholder with an actionable error (finish the ChatGPT login / restart Codex or start a new session), and treats official `401`/`403` and auth errors as non-retryable so failover never silently moves the conversation to another account or pollutes the circuit breaker. The native login is never overwritten — takeover preserves OAuth or API-key material into the backup (falling back to live `auth.json` when the backup is missing), config transforms in `codex_config.rs`/`services/proxy.rs` now fail closed instead of swallowing errors, and stale managed placeholders left in other provider tables are cleaned; the `preserveCodexOfficialAuthOnSwitch` setting copy was updated to clarify that takeover routing always preserves the official login and the toggle now only governs direct (non-routing) third-party switches.
- **GPT-5.6 Context Window for Claude Code Codex Takeover**: When Claude Code is routed to a ChatGPT Codex (Codex OAuth) backend via proxy takeover, CC Switch now injects `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` and `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` set to `372000` into the effective live `settings.json`, so Claude Code stops assuming its default 200K window for the unrecognized GPT model id and auto-compacts before the upstream rejects an oversized prompt. 372000 matches the ChatGPT Codex catalog window for gpt-5.6 — the catalog lists a ~353K effective budget, not the 1.05M API spec — and Claude Code's built-in output reserve and compact buffer then keep the actual compact trigger below that budget. The defaults are gated on every configured model env key (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, the haiku/sonnet/opus/fable defaults, and `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`) starting with `gpt-5.6`: gpt-5.5's upstream catalog oscillates between 272K and 372K and must not inherit them; any non-gpt-5.6 or mixed mapping is skipped (and any value a legacy shared snippet dragged in is stripped), while an explicit user value always wins. The Codex OAuth presets for both Claude Code and Claude Desktop bump their default routes to the gpt-5.6 family (haiku → `gpt-5.6-luna`, main/sonnet/opus → `gpt-5.6`), the custom Codex `config.toml` template default model moves to gpt-5.6, and the Claude Code preset ships both context env keys pinned at 372000 (see the corresponding Changed entry on preset-pinned context windows). On switch-away backfill the injected values are stripped as the mirror-inverse of the injection conditions so program defaults never harden into per-provider explicit values, and both keys are held out of the shared Claude common-config snippet (`services/provider/mod.rs` strip list plus a guard in `live.rs`) because context limits must follow the actual upstream model; six Rust integration tests cover injection, user overrides, legacy-snippet strip, non-gpt5.6 skip, and the backfill round-trip. (openai/codex#31860)
- **GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna Pricing With 1.25x Cache-Write Rate**: The usage dashboard now costs GPT-5.6 traffic using seeded pricing for the three tiers — Sol at 5 / 30 / 0.50, Terra at 2.50 / 15 / 0.25, and Luna at 1 / 6 / 0.10 USD per million input / output / cache-read tokens — cross-checked against OpenAI's pricing page and OpenRouter. Unlike GPT-5.5 and earlier, whose cache writes are seeded at zero, the 5.6 family bills prompt-cache writes at 1.25x the uncached input rate, so cache-write is seeded at 6.25 / 3.125 / 1.25 for Sol / Terra / Luna. The seed set also adds the bare `gpt-5.6` id as the official Sol alias plus effort-suffix variants (`-low`, `-medium`, `-high`, `-xhigh`, `-minimal`), all priced at Sol rates and mirroring the gpt-5.5 accounting shape. Rows are applied through the seed+repair dual-write path in `src-tauri/src/database/schema.rs`: a `repair_current_model_pricing` branch corrects the earlier zero cache-write seeds for the three tiers in existing databases, matching only rows still holding the exact old input/output/cache-read/cache-write values so user-customized prices survive, and no `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump is required.
- **Native Anthropic Messages Protocol as Codex Upstream**: Codex providers can now target a gateway that only exposes the native Anthropic Messages protocol (`/v1/messages`) via a new `anthropic` value on the upstream-format selector in the Codex form; the local proxy performs bidirectional Responses↔Anthropic request, response, and streaming conversion (new `transform_codex_anthropic` / `streaming_codex_anthropic` modules). The form adds an auth-field selector — `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` sends `Authorization: Bearer` (default) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` sends `x-api-key`, mutually exclusive — an optional Claude Code client-impersonation toggle (`impersonateClaudeCode`, off unless explicitly enabled, spoofing User-Agent / `anthropic-beta` / `x-app` / system-prompt first line and dropping Codex/OpenAI fingerprint headers), and a per-provider `maxOutputTokens` override (Codex omits `model_max_output_tokens`, so without it the path falls back to a conservative 8192 that can truncate long or thinking-heavy replies). The bridge injects standard 5-minute ephemeral `cache_control` so system/tools/history are cached rather than resent at full price, defers stripping the `[1m]` long-context marker until after catalog matching and re-emits the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header, gates extended thinking on the trailing turn only so history-resending sessions don't permanently lose it after the first tool call, disables native `web_search` for this profile, drops `tool_choice` when no tools survive filtering, treats a base URL already ending in `/v1/messages` as a full endpoint, and reports truncated streams as incomplete/failed instead of completed. (#5071)
- **Default Model Field for Codex Provider Form**: The Codex provider form now exposes the top-level `model` key of `config.toml` as an editable field, so users can point an existing provider at a newly released model (e.g. `gpt-5.6`) without waiting for a preset update — preset changes only affect newly added providers, while existing ones keep their saved TOML. The field syncs bidirectionally with the TOML editor (mirroring the base-URL pattern), suggests models from the mapping catalog unioned with the provider's `/models` endpoint, offers a one-click "add to mapping" action when the value falls outside a non-empty catalog, and is hidden for official providers. Save-time catalog sync now backfills the first mapping row into the top-level `model` only when the field was left empty, so an explicit value always wins over the implicit row-0 fallback; model names and `base_url` are written with TOML basic-string escaping and control characters are stripped from field input, since `/models` ids are remote data and unescaped interpolation could inject `config.toml` lines such as a forged `[mcp_servers.*]`. The strict model-line matcher (`src/utils/providerConfigUtils.ts`) recognizes escaped output, empty strings, and single-quoted literals to keep extract/set round-trips stable, and the fetched model list is invalidated (with an in-flight sequence guard) whenever request identity changes — base URL, full-URL toggle, API key, or custom User-Agent — so the dropdown never shows a previous provider's models.
- **Switch-Time Common-Config Autosync Now Covers Codex**: When switching away from a Codex provider with `common_config_enabled`, the service now re-extracts the shareable portion of its live `config.toml` into the stored common-config snippet — the same live-to-snippet sync that previously ran only for Claude — so preferences you tweak directly in the running Codex config propagate to every opted-in provider and a removed key isn't silently re-injected on the next switch. Codex was gated out before because its TOML extractor leaked provider-specific and injected content; `extract_codex_common_config` now strips top-level `model`, `model_provider`, `base_url`, and `wire_api`, the entire `[model_providers]` table, `mcp_servers` and the legacy `[mcp.servers]` form, the top-level `experimental_bearer_token` fallback (which would otherwise leak the API key into the shared snippet), the `model_catalog_json` catalog pointer, and the injected `web_search = "disabled"` sentinel, while keeping a user-set `web_search` value as a shareable preference. The sync in `services/provider/mod.rs` is scoped strictly to Claude and Codex (Gemini is still excluded), skipped when the snippet was explicitly cleared, and all failures are warn-only and never block the switch; the autosync-before-strip ordering also self-heals stale snippet values previously baked into provider snapshots, since the re-extracted snippet matches the live values and the value-match strip removes them on the same switch.
- **Claude Subagent Model Configuration**: Claude providers can now pin a dedicated sub-agent model through a new "Subagent" row in the provider form, writing the `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` env key so Claude Code's spawned sub-agents run on a chosen (typically cheaper or faster) model. The row supports the `[1M]` marker but has no display-name field — it renders a "Not shown in /model" placeholder since the sub-agent model never appears in the `/model` menu — and the "quick set" button now fills it alongside the other tiers. On the proxy takeover path (`services/proxy.rs`), `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` is added to `CLAUDE_MODEL_OVERRIDE_ENV_KEYS` so it is written when a provider configures it and stale values are cleared when a provider omits it, and the model mapper (`proxy/model_mapper.rs`) gains a `subagent_model` field that passes a request through unchanged when its model (comparing with the 1M suffix stripped) matches the configured sub-agent model, instead of collapsing it to the default-model fallback. The key is also excluded from the shared Claude common-config snippet in `services/provider/mod.rs` so it can't leak across providers, and `modelRoleSubagent` / `modelNoDisplayName` labels were added in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). (#4830)
- **1M Context Checkbox on the Claude Fallback Model Field**: The Claude provider form's fallback model field (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, the "default/fallback model") now carries the same 1M checkbox that the role-specific Sonnet/Opus/Fable rows already had, so a fallback model backed by a 1M-token window can declare it instead of silently being treated as 200K. Checking the box appends the `[1M]` marker to the fallback model id and unchecking strips it, reusing the shared `hasClaudeOneMMarker` / `setClaudeOneMMarker` / `stripClaudeOneMMarker` helpers, and the checkbox is a no-op when the model field is empty. The marker is written in the documented uppercase form (`[1M]`), which Claude Code parses case-insensitively. This is a frontend-only change to `ClaudeFormFields.tsx`. (#5124, fixes #3679)
- **Zhipu (智谱) Team Plan Quota Query Support**: Added quota-query support for Zhipu's team plan (团队套餐), which the personal-plan query could not reach: it hits the same `open.bigmodel.cn` quota endpoint with `?type=2` and requires two extra request headers, `bigmodel-organization` and `bigmodel-project`, so `detect_provider` cannot tell it apart from the personal plan by base URL alone. The usage-script modal gains a "Zhipu GLM Team" template with organization-ID and project-ID inputs (preserved when switching templates), and the backend routes on an explicit `coding_plan_provider == "zhipu_team"` identifier threaded through the usage script, IPC command, and background query path; the new `query_zhipu_team` in `services/coding_plan.rs` pins the CN site, appends `?type=2`, and shares response parsing (`zhipu_quota_from_body` / `parse_zhipu_token_tiers`) with the personal plan. All three of API key + organization ID + project ID are required — missing any one returns a NotFound that prompts the user to complete them (identifier match is case-insensitive) — and new copy was added across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). (#5128)
- **OpenCode Provider Form Gains Headers and Per-Model Token-Limit Editors**: The OpenCode provider form now exposes two previously unreachable config fields as structured editors: a Headers section for the provider's `options.headers` (arbitrary HTTP headers like `HTTP-Referer` or `X-Title` sent with provider requests) with add/remove rows and case-insensitive duplicate-name rejection that reverts the input on conflict, and per-model Token Limits (Context and Output number inputs writing `model.limit.context` / `model.limit.output`, where clearing the field removes it and negative or non-finite values are rejected while valid ones are truncated to integers). The Extra Options block was reworked into a collapsible section (its i18n label stays "Extra Options") that auto-expands when options already exist. Both the headers and extra-options editors switched their placeholder draft keys to colon-bearing prefixes (`draft-header:` / `draft-option:`) — a code comment notes a colon is invalid in an HTTP field name so a draft key cannot collide with a legitimate header, and the same technique now guards option keys — and those drafts are stripped on save, fixing a bug where the old filter discarded any real option key literally starting with `option-` (the former placeholder prefix). New i18n keys were added across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), and `aria-label`s were added for the header add/remove and model-details toggle controls in `OpenCodeFormFields.tsx`; the headers state and draft-stripping logic live in `useOpencodeFormState.ts`. (#2907)
- **Tencent Hunyuan Hy3 Model Pricing**: Seeded pricing for Tencent's Hunyuan Hy3 (released 2026-07-06, 256K context) so its usage is billed instead of showing $0. The rows are added to `seed_model_pricing` in `schema.rs` under both the `hunyuan-hy3` and `hy3` ids, since the upstream billing id isn't yet confirmed and one of the two should match logged usage. Prices follow Tencent's launch-day list rate (CNY 1 / 4 / 0.25 per Mtok input / output / cache-hit), converted at 1 USD ≈ 7.14 to $0.14 / $0.56 / $0.035, with `cache_write` left at `0` because no write rate is published. Hy3 actually uses input-length tiered billing (<16K / 16-32K / ≥32K) but the single-price table holds the lowest tier, so long-context requests are under-billed until this is revisited against the official billing page. Being a brand-new model it is seed-only, applied on next app start via `ensure_model_pricing_seeded` with no `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump.

### Changed

- **Codex Chat Prompt-Cache Routing**: Added provider-aware `prompt_cache_key` injection on the Codex Responses→Chat Completions bridge. Kimi Coding and OpenAI official endpoints are enabled automatically, Kimi's preset opts in explicitly, and unknown OpenAI-compatible gateways remain off to avoid strict-schema 400s. The key is taken from an explicit client value or a real client-provided session ID—never a generated per-request UUID—with an advanced Auto/Enabled/Disabled override in all four UI locales.
- **Provider Connectivity Configuration Simplified**: Removed the obsolete per-provider `testConfig` override (timeout, retry count, and degraded-latency threshold) from provider forms, frontend/backend provider metadata, and reachability-check merging. The lightweight `base_url` probe now always uses the single global connectivity-check configuration, while automatic failover remains driven exclusively by its separate proxy timeout and circuit-breaker settings. Also renamed the remaining settings UI and API modules from model-test terminology to connectivity-check terminology, removed the retired first-use confirmation flag, and deleted stale model/prompt/error copy across all four locales.
- **Codex Image Capabilities Are Inferred Without a User Toggle**: Generated Codex model catalogs now advertise only models in CC Switch's confirmed, exact text-only registry as `input_modalities = ["text"]`; GPT, aliases, new suffix variants, and all unknown models fail open to `["text", "image"]`. The rectifier's “Text-Only Model Preflight” switch continues to control only proactive proxy request-body replacement and does not change Codex's catalog declaration. Live catalog reverse-import also collapses inferred modalities instead of persisting them as hidden row overrides, so a later registry correction or a model's multimodal upgrade takes effect automatically; only declarations that differ from inference survive a DB-missing/import round-trip.
- **Context Window Values Pinned in Presets Instead of Editable Form Fields**: The `Codex` (ChatGPT/GPT-5.6) and `Kimi For Coding` presets no longer surface the "Max Context Tokens" and "Auto Compact Window" inputs in the provider form; the numbers are now hardcoded directly in the preset env (`372000`/`372000` for Codex, `262144`/`262144` for Kimi For Coding) instead of being exposed as editable `templateValues`. This drops two fields most users never need to touch while keeping both env keys present on purpose: since Claude Code resolves the compact window as `min(model window, value)`, setting it equal to the declared context window is behavior-neutral today, but pinning it explicitly shields the local compaction trigger against remote-config experiments that dial it down. The rare user who wants different numbers can still edit `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` / `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` directly in the provider's JSON editor. The change is confined to `claudeProviderPresets.ts` and its tests.
- **Universal Provider Auto-Syncs to Live Configs After Being Added**: Adding a universal (multi-app) provider through the Add Provider dialog now immediately pushes it to its live target configs instead of only saving it to the database, so the cross-app config lands in Claude/Codex/Gemini without a separate manual sync step. After `universalProvidersApi.upsert` succeeds, `AddProviderDialog` calls `universalProvidersApi.sync(provider.id)` and reports the combined outcome: a success toast (`universalProvider.addedAndSynced`) when the sync lands, or a non-blocking warning toast (`universalProvider.addedButSyncFailed`) when the provider was saved but the sync failed — while a save failure still aborts early with the existing error toast (`universalProvider.addFailed`) and never attempts the sync. The now-unused `universalProvider.addSuccess` key was removed from all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW) and a new `universalProvider.addedButSyncFailed` key was added alongside the pre-existing `addedAndSynced` key. (#2811)
- **SudoCode Promoted to Paid Sponsor Across Six Clients**: The existing SudoCode preset — previously a `sudocode.us` provider that collided by name with an unrelated service — is replaced in place by the new paid sponsor SudoCode on `sudocode.chat`, now marked `isPartner` (gold star) with `partnerPromotionKey: "sudocode"` and a four-locale promo blurb (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). The preset spans six clients: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes; the Gemini entry was removed as outside sponsor scope. All endpoints move to `api.sudocode.chat` (the presets that carry an `endpointCandidates` list — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex — collapse it to that single host, dropping the old `sudocode.run` fallback), and the `apiKeyUrl` points to the attributed `sudocode.chat/register?utm_source=ccswitch&utm_medium=partner` signup while `websiteUrl` moves to `sudocode.chat`. Claude Code and Claude Desktop use direct Anthropic passthrough with no model mapping, whereas Codex/OpenCode/OpenClaw/Hermes default to `gpt-5.6-sol` (replacing the old `gpt-5.5`) — Codex/Hermes/OpenClaw over the native Responses format and OpenCode via `@ai-sdk/openai`. The provider icon is refreshed to the new brand PNG, and the promo copy surfaces that one key drives Claude Opus 4.8 on the Claude apps and GPT-5.6 on Codex plus a CNY ¥10 trial-credit offer.
- **LongCat Presets Updated to LongCat-2.0**: The LongCat presets across Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw, and OpenCode now default to `LongCat-2.0` in place of the retired `LongCat-Flash-Chat` / `LongCat-2.0-Preview`, advertising the model's real 1M (1048576) context window and — for the Claude Code preset — a raised `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` of 131072 plus an added `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` pin. OpenClaw's and OpenCode's base URL move to the `.../openai/v1` path (Codex and Hermes already used it), and the OpenClaw model entry gains `reasoning: false`, `input: ["text"]`, `maxTokens: 131072`, a bumped `contextWindow` of 1048576, and a new `compat.maxTokensField` (`max_tokens`) hint backed by a new optional `compat` field on the `OpenClawModel` type. Because LongCat-2.0 is text-only, the proxy's media sanitizer allowlist now classifies `longcat-2.0` (case-insensitively, keeping the retired `longcat-flash-chat` name for saved configs) so images pasted into a LongCat-2.0 session are replaced with the unsupported-image marker instead of being forwarded upstream and hard-rejected; a regression test covers the classification. (#4838)
- **Volcengine/Doubao/BytePlus Website Links Restored to Invite Pages**: Reverts the v3.16.5 change (`56248087`) that had pointed the `火山Agentplan`, `DouBaoSeed`, and `BytePlus` presets' `websiteUrl` at their product homepages. Per the commit, the `websiteUrl` for these three presets is intentionally the same ccswitch-attributed campaign/invite link as `apiKeyUrl`, so it is restored across all six app preset files — `火山Agentplan` back to its `activity/codingplan` link, `BytePlus` to its `product/modelark` link, and `DouBaoSeed` to the Ark console API-key page, each carrying the `utm_*` attribution params. The `apiKeyUrl` links were already left intact by the reverted commit and are unchanged.
- **Code0.ai Invite Link Updated to Agent Register URL**: The Code0.ai sponsor's `apiKeyUrl` moves from the `?source=ccswitch` referral to the new agent-register invite link `https://code0.ai/agent/register/B2XHxGjGmRvqgznY`, updated across all seven app presets and the Code0 sponsor rows in all four READMEs (`README.md`, `README_ZH.md`, `README_JA.md`, `README_DE.md`). The bare `code0.ai` API endpoint stays untouched.
- **Dropped the Redundant OpenAI Compatible Preset**: Removed the `OpenAI Compatible` custom-template preset from the OpenCode and OpenClaw preset lists so the picker no longer shows two entries pointing at the same place. It was a duplicate entry point — the built-in `custom` provider flow already exposes an interface-format selector whose default (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` / `openai-completions`) seeds a byte-identical starting config. Existing providers are unaffected, since presets only seed form defaults on creation and saved providers store concrete `npm`/`baseUrl`/`apiKey`/`models` values; the `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` dropdown label is deliberately kept as the format option users pick in the custom flow, not the deleted preset.

### Fixed

- **Align Codex OAuth Client Identity to Fix 404s on Newest ChatGPT Models**: The newest ChatGPT-gated subscription models (e.g. `gpt-5.6-luna`) now resolve correctly when routed through the local proxy takeover with an official Codex OAuth account, instead of returning a misleading `404 Model not found` even though the account had access. ChatGPT's Codex backend performs model cohort routing by the `originator`+`version` header pair, and cc-switch previously identified takeover requests as `originator: cc-switch` with no version, landing them in a cohort where `gpt-5.6-luna` resolved to an undeployed internal engine. The `CodexOAuth` auth strategy in `proxy/providers/claude.rs` now sends `originator: codex_cli_rs` paired with `version: 0.144.1`, matching the real Codex CLI and satisfying luna's `minimal_client_version` requirement of `0.144.0`. Both headers must be sent together (dropping either re-triggers the 404), and the `CODEX_OAUTH_CLIENT_VERSION` constant must be bumped whenever a newer target model raises the minimum. A direct HTTP A/B test against the live backend confirmed the old identity 404ed while the aligned identity completed successfully, so no WebSocket transport workaround is required.
- **Fail Closed on Responses Upstream Failures Instead of Returning Empty Replies**: When the proxy bridges an Anthropic-format client (Claude Code / Claude Desktop pointed at a Responses gateway) to an OpenAI Responses upstream, a semantic upstream failure that arrives inside an HTTP 2xx body — a `{status:"failed"|"cancelled"}` object, an `error` envelope, or a `response.failed`/`error` SSE event before any output — is now surfaced as a real error so failover can select a different provider, instead of being converted into a silent, empty `end_turn`. The forwarder validates buffered/JSON bodies (`validate_responses_success_response`) and primes streaming responses up to 256 KB (`validate_responses_stream_start`) while still inside the retry loop, and the streaming converter emits an Anthropic `error` event then ignores every event after a terminal so a late delta cannot synthesize a spurious `message_start`. Streams that end cleanly after partial text now finalize as an explicit `max_tokens`-style incomplete turn with content blocks closed in protocol order, whereas a stream cut off mid tool-call or mid-reasoning (partial JSON or a missing thinking signature) yields a `stream_truncated` error rather than a corrupt turn, and on the Codex→Anthropic direction a truncated tool call is reported `incomplete` instead of `completed`. Gateways that ignore `stream:true` and return a single whole JSON document (even without a JSON content-type) are now recognized and expanded into a full Anthropic SSE lifecycle, and malformed client-supplied history is raised as an `InvalidRequest` — a `NonRetryable` category — so it fails fast instead of retrying across every provider. Touches `forwarder.rs`, `streaming_responses.rs`, `streaming_codex_anthropic.rs`, `transform_responses.rs`, and `transform_codex_anthropic.rs`.
- **Preserve Reasoning, Tool Results, and System Roles Across the Responses/Anthropic Bridge**: Content and token accounting that crosses the Responses↔Anthropic bridge in multi-turn tool loops is now preserved instead of being dropped or corrupted. Encrypted Responses `reasoning` items round-trip losslessly by being carried inside a versioned bridge-owned Anthropic thinking `signature` (or a `redacted_thinking` `data` field, prefixed `ccswitch-openai-reasoning-v1:`) and restored on replay, orphaned reasoning-only assistant turns are discarded so they cannot brick the next request with a missing-following-item error, and the streaming converter now consumes the official `response.reasoning_summary_text.*` / `response.reasoning_text.*` event vocabulary (keeping `response.reasoning.*` as a compatibility alias), tracks concurrent items by stable id/output-index, emits the signature before closing the block, and recovers tool arguments from `*.done` / `output_item.done` events when a gateway skips deltas. Non-streaming Responses→Anthropic tool calls with empty arguments normalize to `{}`, invalid arguments in an incomplete turn degrade to `{}` with a warning, and invalid arguments on a completed response are rejected, while on the Codex→Anthropic request path malformed or non-object arguments raise a non-retryable `InvalidRequest`, incomplete historical tool calls are dropped, and only signed thinking blocks are re-encoded as encrypted reasoning. Structured tool results now keep their `is_error` flag, text, base64/URL images, and PDF/`input_file` documents in both directions instead of collapsing to a canonical JSON string, and historical `system`/`developer` messages are hoisted into Anthropic `system` rather than being silently demoted to user turns. For accounting, usage from a successful upstream request is recorded even when the subsequent conversion fails, and the Codex→Anthropic bridge keeps standard 5-minute prompt caching on by default while honoring the dedicated `cache_injection` sub-switch. Touches `reasoning_bridge.rs`, `transform_responses.rs`, `transform_codex_anthropic.rs`, `streaming_responses.rs`, `handlers.rs`, and `forwarder.rs`.
- **Account for Cache-Write Tokens in Proxy Usage and Cost**: Prompt-cache write tokens are now billed correctly on the proxy usage dashboard. The parser reads cache writes from OpenAI/Codex-style usage details (`input_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` and `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens`) and preserves them through every response-usage conversion path — Chat→Responses, Responses→Anthropic, Anthropic→Responses, and OpenAI/Chat→Anthropic (`transform_codex_chat.rs`, `transform_responses.rs`, `transform_codex_anthropic.rs`, `transform.rs`, `streaming.rs`) — so cache creation is no longer dropped when a request crosses a format boundary. Because a Codex/Gemini provider's reported `input_tokens` is inclusive of both cache reads and cache writes, the cost calculator now subtracts both before applying the input rate; previously only reads were removed, so cache-write tokens were double-charged at both the input rate and the cache-creation rate. To keep historical rows accurate across this shift, a new `input_token_semantics` column (schema v13; `0` legacy = subtract reads only, `1` total-inclusive = subtract reads and writes, `2` fresh = no subtraction) records how each row's `input_tokens` was stored, so the cost backfill subtracts reads only for pre-existing rows and reads-plus-writes for new total-inclusive rows, while daily rollups are normalized to fresh input and stamped `2`. v12 databases gain the column on both `proxy_request_logs` and `usage_daily_rollups` via `migrate_v12_to_v13`, and Claude-style rows stay fresh input with no subtraction.
- **Stronger Prompt-Cache Breakpoint Injection on the Proxy Bridge**: On the proxy paths that inject Anthropic `cache_control` breakpoints — the `codex_responses_to_anthropic` takeover bridge and the Bedrock native optimizer — the injector now spends its four-breakpoint budget more effectively so long, tool-heavy conversations keep hitting the prompt cache instead of re-sending system, tools, and history at full price every turn. Beyond marking the tools tail, system tail, and the latest cacheable message, it now adds a second older user anchor (`msgs-prior-user`) when at least four messages exist and budget remains, keeping the stable prefix inside Anthropic's 20-block lookback from the newest breakpoint. Injection is short-circuited unless both the optimizer master switch (`enabled`) and the `cache_injection` sub-switch are on, `thinking`/`redacted_thinking` blocks are never chosen as cache targets, and injected markers use Anthropic's standard 5-minute TTL. Caller-owned breakpoints are preserved verbatim — never deleted, reordered, or rewritten — and when a caller already ships more than the supported four, the injector logs a warning, adds no automatic breakpoints, and leaves the markers in place (`cache_injector.rs`, `forwarder.rs`).
- **Kimi For Coding's 256K Context Window Now Takes Effect**: The Kimi For Coding preset's standalone `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=262144` (added in #4401 and shipped in 3.16.4) never actually applied, because Claude Code caps unrecognized non-Claude model ids at a 200K window and resolves the compact window as `min(model window, value)`, clamping 262144 back down to 200K. The preset now pairs it with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (both pinned to 262144) and explicitly routes the endpoint's `kimi-for-coding` alias across `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and all three tier keys (`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU/SONNET/OPUS_MODEL`), since Claude Code ignores both context envs for `claude-`-prefixed ids — the non-Claude alias is what unlocks the enlarged window. For already-saved providers, `build_effective_settings_with_common_config` in `services/provider/live.rs` injects the same two context defaults (262144) into the effective live settings at switch time for any provider whose `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is the Kimi coding endpoint (`https://api.kimi.com/coding`), with a mirror-inverse strip on backfill so an injected default never hardens into stored provider config and an explicit user value always wins. Because the alias routing lives only in the preset and not in the injection, a provider saved from the old preset — which set neither the alias nor `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` — stays effectively at 200K until the preset is re-applied. Three tests cover backfill injection, user-override preservation, and injected-only strip.
- **Deleted Codex MCP Servers No Longer Resurrected on Provider Activation**: MCP servers are owned by the database `mcp_servers` table and the `[mcp_servers]` section in Codex's live `config.toml` is only a projection re-synced after every write, but switching away used to bake that projection into the stored provider snapshot — so a server you deleted in the app came back to life the next time you activated that provider, and per-entry reconcile (which only knows rows still in the DB) could never clean up the orphan. Switch-away backfill now strips `[mcp_servers]` (and the legacy `[mcp.servers]` form) from the stored settings via `strip_codex_mcp_servers_from_settings`, and any snapshot already polluted self-heals the next time you switch away from it. One user-visible consequence: a hand-written `[mcp_servers.*]` section in a Codex provider's config is stripped out of the stored snapshot the first time you switch away, so going forward define Codex MCP servers through the MCP manager (the DB `mcp_servers` table) rather than by hand-editing the provider config.
- **Codex MCP Sync Fails Closed on an Unparseable config.toml**: When writing a single MCP server into Codex, `sync_single_server_to_codex` silently fell back to an empty `toml_edit` document if the existing `config.toml` failed to parse and then wrote the whole file back — wiping every other section (`model`, `model_providers`, comments) and leaving only the one synced `[mcp_servers.<id>]` entry, a destructive fallback left behind when an earlier fix (`3a548152`) hardened only the removal path. The sync path now returns an `McpValidation` error and leaves the file untouched, matching the fail-closed behavior already used on the read/validate path, so a temporarily malformed config can no longer be silently truncated to a single MCP table.
- **MCP Operations Now Report Per-App Failures Instead of Silently Blocking Others**: Importing MCP servers from apps used to swallow every importer error with `unwrap_or(0)`, so a corrupt Codex `config.toml` surfaced only as "imported 0 servers" with no hint anything went wrong; `import_from_all_apps` now imports each app (claude/codex/gemini/opencode/hermes) best-effort and, when any fail, reports an aggregated error naming the failing apps alongside the count that did import, with the frontend refreshing the server list on settle so partially-imported servers still appear. On the projection side `sync_all_enabled` iterated every app with `?`, so one app's unparseable live file (e.g. a broken `~/.claude.json` that passes the existence gate but fails to parse) blocked every app behind it in iteration order and bubbled a false "switch failed" back even though the target app's live file and the database were already updated; switch and save now re-project only the target app through the new `sync_enabled_for_app` and degrade projection failure to a warning, while config-import and cloud-restore keep the all-apps sweep but collect failures best-effort. Toggling `unify_codex_session_history`, which rewrites the current official provider's live `config.toml` in full and drops the `[mcp_servers]` projection, now re-projects Codex MCP through that same target-only path so enabled servers no longer silently vanish until the next provider switch. In every degraded case the projection self-heals on the next switch or MCP toggle.
- **Codex Common-Config Form Preserves Comments and Key Order**: Toggling "use common config" in the Codex provider form used to route the merge through the frontend `smol-toml` implementation, which re-serialized the whole document (parse → deep-merge → stringify): comments were dropped, keys were reordered, and empty parent table headers like `[model_providers]` were synthesized — the long-standing "config.toml keeps getting reordered" symptom. The merge now runs on a backend command backed by the same `merge_toml_table_like` / `remove_toml_table_like` used to write live configs, so the form preview and the live write share one merge semantic and hand-written formatting survives edit-time merges, and the frontend helper was deleted outright so the pattern can't come back. Because the operations are now async, a landing result is discarded unless it is still current: a per-hook sequence number covers rapid toggle/save races so an earlier merge resolving after a later removal can't flip the switch back (last operation wins), and a config-baseline check keeps a stale merge from clobbering a TOML the user hand-edited while the merge was in flight, with the checkbox self-healing via the existing inference effect.
- **Inject a Single Auth Placeholder on Managed Claude Takeover**: Switching the managed Claude provider from a third-party endpoint (DeepSeek/MiMo/…) to a Codex-managed provider wrote both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` as `PROXY_MANAGED` into `~/.claude/settings.json`, so Claude Code warned "Both ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set - auth may not work as expected" on every run — an accretion artifact of the original API-key insert (#1049, Copilot) and the later `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` preservation that avoided a login prompt (#3784), which added the token without removing the key. The `ManagedAccount` branch of `apply_claude_takeover_fields_for_provider` now clears all token keys and injects exactly one placeholder: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for Codex-managed providers and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Copilot; local-proxy auth is unaffected because the forwarder resolves the `PROXY_MANAGED` placeholder from either header. Because enabling takeover short-circuits (`return Ok(())`) when the live config already matches the current proxy, users upgrading with an existing double-key `settings.json` may need to toggle Claude routing off and back on once (or switch providers) to trigger the rewrite. (#4919, #5095)
- **Skip Reachability Probes for Official Providers**: Health/connectivity checks no longer derive an unauthenticated probe target from an official provider's runtime adapter defaults. Batch `stream_check_all_providers` now skips any entry whose `category` is `official`, and `StreamCheckService::resolve_base_url` returns an explicit error for official providers instead of falling back to a first-party endpoint (e.g. `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`) and probing it without credentials — a request that is meaningless and always fails. The connectivity-check button is already hidden for these providers in `ProviderCard.tsx`, so this is defense-in-depth that also matters now that the built-in Codex official provider participates in takeover; a regression test covers the Codex official provider so a future adapter change cannot silently reintroduce the probe.
- **Usage and Quota Queries Reject Transient Transport Failures So Retry and Keep-Last-Good Work**: Usage and quota queries frequently showed spurious "query failed" states that a manual refresh could not clear, because every transport-level failure — including read-timeouts mid-body — was folded into `Ok(success:false)`, so react-query's retry never fired and the failure body poisoned the cache as if it were real data. The `balance`, `coding_plan`, and `subscription` services now return `Err` for send failures and body-read failures, reading the body via `bytes()` before `serde_json::from_slice` (reqwest's `json()` wraps read errors as `Decode`, which made error-kind checks on it dead code), while auth/4xx/parse errors stay `Ok(success:false)` and surface immediately; the script path maps transient `AppError` keys (`request_failed` / `read_response_failed`) to `Err`, Volcengine gains a `Transient` call variant, HTTP 429 is now classified transient alongside 5xx, and expired-credential retries propagate the transient error instead of rewriting it as "OAuth token has expired". The command layer skips snapshot persistence, the `usage-cache-updated` emit, and tray refresh on `Err` so the cache bridge cannot overwrite retained data. On the frontend, `resolveDisplayUsage` (generalized to subscription quotas via a new options object carrying a `rejected` flag) re-anchors stale success data retained by react-query across rejections to `dataUpdatedAt` so it expires through the same 10-minute keep-last-good window instead of masking a longer outage indefinitely, `useSubscriptionQuota` / `useCodexOauthQuota` gain keep-last-good with per-scope snapshot reset, rejected queries with no displayable value synthesize a failure placeholder carrying the real error message so the footer keeps a retry entry point, and `UsageScriptModal` surfaces string rejections via `extractErrorMessage`. (#3820)
- **Codex Sub-Agent Session Usage Now Counted in Local Statistics**: Token usage from Codex sub-agent (spawned agent) sessions was missing from local usage statistics because the parser keyed each session's synthetic `request_id` on `session_meta.session_id`, but a sub-agent's log carries the parent thread's `session_id` while its own unique identity lives in the `id` / `thread_id` field — so multiple sub-agents under one parent collapsed onto colliding request IDs and were dropped as duplicates. `session_usage_codex.rs` now extracts a unique `thread_id` per file (preferring `id` / `thread_id` over `session_id`) and prefixes request IDs with `codex_session:thread-v1:<thread_id>:<index>`, giving each sub-agent distinct rows. Because fork/sub-agent logs first replay the parent thread's history before the takeover event, the parser detects a history-snapshot boundary (via `forked_from_id` / `subagent` source markers plus a `thread_settings_applied` or `inter_agent_communication` event) and uses the replayed `token_count` events only to restore the cumulative baseline instead of double-counting them as new usage. Archived logs under `archived_sessions/` inherit the sync cursor from their original path by filename suffix, so re-parsing an archived copy imports only appended usage rather than re-importing the whole thread; the fix ships with unit tests covering identity extraction, replay-baseline accounting, distinct request IDs, and archived-cursor inheritance. (#5187)
- **Codex Free-Plan 30-Day Quota Window Now Renders in Footer and Tray**: Codex free accounts are metered on a rolling 30-day secondary window (`limit_window_seconds = 2,592,000`) instead of the weekly window paid plans use, and although the backend already mapped this to the tier name `30_day`, neither the frontend `TIER_I18N_KEYS` whitelist nor the tray's `TIER_LABEL_GROUPS` month group recognized it — so `SubscriptionQuotaView` filtered the tier out and, since it is the only surviving tier for a free account, the quota footer rendered nothing while the tray's `format_subscription_summary` returned `None` and showed no quota at all. A single-sourced `TIER_THIRTY_DAY` ("30_day") constant now ties together the backend `window_seconds_to_tier_name` mapping (which maps `2_592_000` explicitly), the tray's month ("m") group, and the frontend whitelist (`30_day → subscription.thirtyDay`), with the `thirtyDay` label added to all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). Two regression tests lock in the window-seconds-to-tier mappings and assert that a 30-day-only Codex account still renders in the tray, guarding the invariant that any tier visible in the footer must not leave the tray blank. (#3651, #4886)
- **Usage Dashboard Refresh Interval Persists Across Restarts**: The usage dashboard's auto-refresh cadence was component-local state that reset to 30s on every restart, so a user who chose a different interval (off, 5s, 10s, or 60s) had to re-select it each session. The dashboard now reads and writes the choice through a new `usageDashboardRefreshIntervalMs` app setting: `UsageDashboard` takes `refreshIntervalMs` / `onRefreshIntervalChange` props wired from `SettingsPage` to the persisted settings, initializes from the saved value (normalized to a known option, falling back to the 30s default for unrecognized values), and applies changes optimistically — invalidating the usage queries immediately — while rolling back the selection if the save fails. The field is added to the Rust `AppSettings` struct, the TypeScript `Settings` type, and the zod settings schema, and three component tests cover mount-from-saved, persist-on-change, and rollback-on-failure. (#5057)
- **Exclude Fable Tier Model Env Keys From the Shared Claude Common Config**: Fable is Claude's fourth model-mapping tier (added in v3.16.3), but its `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL_NAME` env keys were missing from the provider-specific exclusion list, so a provider's Fable model pin could leak into the shared common-config snippet and then be injected into other providers on the next switch. Both keys are now stripped in `extract_claude_common_config` alongside the haiku/sonnet/opus pins, guarded by a regression test. The same commit also completes Fable's proxy-takeover support: the two keys are added to `CLAUDE_MODEL_OVERRIDE_ENV_KEYS` (now 12 entries) and the takeover writes a stable `claude-fable-5` role alias (`CLAUDE_TAKEOVER_FABLE_MODEL`), reapplying it when the provider configures Fable and clearing stale values otherwise, mirroring the other three tiers; when Fable is unconfigured no alias is written and the mapper falls back fable→opus. (#5206, fixes #4272)
- **Default Missing Tool Schema Types and Restore the API Key Field for Uncategorized Providers**: Two provider-facing fixes. First, when a client sends a tool whose Anthropic `input_schema` omits the top-level `type` or is an empty `{}`, the proxy passed the schema through the shared `clean_schema` helper without filling in the missing type, producing an OpenAI `parameters` object that strict gateways reject. `clean_schema` (defined once in `transform.rs` and reused by the Responses converter via `super::transform::clean_schema`, so both the Anthropic→OpenAI Chat and Responses paths pick up the change) now defaults a missing root `type` to `"object"` — adding an empty `properties: {}` only when properties is also absent — and applies the defaulting only to the root schema via a new `is_root` flag threaded through a `clean_schema_inner` helper, so nested sub-schemas (an `anyOf` string/null union, an `items`-only array) are preserved unchanged rather than having a spurious `type: "object"` forced onto them. Second, editing a provider with no category (a historically imported or hand-built custom provider) hid the Claude API key input, because `useApiKeyState` only showed and auto-created the field in add mode with a defined non-official category; the gate now keys off category alone, showing and populating the field for any provider that isn't `official` or `cloud_provider` — including the undefined-category edit case — while `official` (OAuth-only, input disabled) and `cloud_provider` (which use dedicated auth fields rather than an Anthropic key) stay conservative. New unit and hook tests cover both converters and the uncategorized/official/cloud-provider key paths. (#5069)
- **Media Fallback for Volcano GLM 5.2 Text-Only Image 400s**: When the local proxy takes over a Volcano Coding Plan provider running GLM 5.2, image blocks in a request no longer produce a dead 400 — the rectifier's media fallback in `src-tauri/src/proxy/media_sanitizer.rs` now covers GLM 5.2 on both its preventive and reactive paths. Preventively, the text-only model registry gains `glm-5.2` as an exact tail match (deliberately not a prefix, so a future multimodal `glm-5.2v` variant following Zhipu's 4v/5v naming keeps its images), stripping image blocks before they reach the text-only endpoint. Reactively, because the gateway's error `Model only support text input` never mentions image/vision/media and drops the third-person `s`, a new self-evident phrase list (`only support text` / `only supports text`) now asserts a modality rejection on its own and bypasses the `mentions_image` gate that previously discarded the error before the fallback hints could run; the old `only supports text` hint is folded into that list. Regression tests exercise the verbatim #5025 error body, the `glm-5.2[1M]` mapped-model form, and a `glm-5.2v` negative assertion. (#5025)
- **Display Renamed Codex Session Titles**: Sessions renamed inside Codex now show their renamed titles in the session manager instead of silently falling back to the original first-message text. The scanner (`src-tauri/src/session_manager/providers/codex.rs`) loads thread titles from Codex's `session_index.jsonl` and `state_5.sqlite` — resolving the DB path from `sqlite_home` / `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` through a new shared `codex_state_db` module that deduplicates path resolution previously copy-pasted with the history-migration code — and prefers a stored thread title over the first user message when building each session's display title. The read-only title query adds a `busy_timeout` so a lookup during a concurrent Codex write no longer fails immediately with `SQLITE_BUSY` and drops back to the first message, and the `title == first_user_message` check is pushed into a NULL-safe SQL `WHERE` clause (matching Codex's `distinct_thread_metadata_title` semantics) so the potentially large `first_user_message` column no longer crosses into Rust. (#4927)
- **Live Config Edits for OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Now Sync Into the Database on Startup**: The startup auto-import for the live-config-managed apps previously skipped any provider whose id already existed in the database, so edits made directly to the OpenCode, OpenClaw, or Hermes (`~/.hermes/config.yaml`) live files — a changed base URL, an added or renamed model — were never picked up after the first import and silently diverged from the app's stored copy. The `import_{opencode,openclaw,hermes}_providers_from_live` functions in `services/provider/live.rs` now look up each existing provider and, when its live `settings_config` differs, rewrite the stored provider from the live file (OpenCode additionally refreshes the display name from the live `name`, falling back to the existing name rather than the id); the returned count now covers both new imports and updates, and the startup log line changed from "Imported N" to "Synced N". The sync runs on every launch from `lib.rs::run()`, is a no-op when nothing changed, and is fully non-fatal — a provider that vanishes mid-import or a DB lookup error is warned and skipped, and users with no live file still take the quiet `Ok(0)` path. (#4712, #5098)
- **OpenCode Session Resume Command Updated to Current CLI Syntax**: The Session Manager displayed and copied `opencode session resume <id>` as the resume command for OpenCode sessions, which is not the OpenCode CLI's current resume syntax, so pasting the copied command would not resume the session. Both the SQLite-scanned (`scan_sessions_sqlite`) and JSON-parsed (`parse_session`) session paths in `session_manager/providers/opencode.rs` now emit `opencode -s <id>` to match the CLI's actual resume flag. (#2359)

### Docs

- **Codex + Kimi Local Routing Guides**: New step-by-step guides explain how to run Kimi inside the Codex CLI through CC Switch's local routing, motivated by a protocol mismatch: the newer Codex CLI targets the OpenAI Responses API while both Kimi Open Platform and Kimi For Coding expose the OpenAI Chat Completions shape (`/chat/completions`), so pointing a Kimi endpoint straight at Codex typically 404s on `/responses` or yields streams Codex cannot parse. The guides walk through adding a Codex provider from the built-in `Kimi` (Open Platform, pay-as-you-go, `kimi-k2.7-code`) or `Kimi For Coding` (membership, `kimi-for-coding`) preset, and lay out the four-step conversion chain: Codex is written to talk to `http://127.0.0.1:15721/v1` with `wire_api = "responses"` kept in place, the provider's `meta.apiFormat = "openai_chat"` flags the real upstream as Chat, the route rewrites `/responses` to `/chat/completions` and converts the body, then converts the upstream Chat JSON/SSE back into the Responses shape Codex expects. Added under `docs/guides/` in English, Japanese, and Chinese with accompanying UI screenshots.
- **new-api Sponsor Row in READMEs**: The open-source AI infrastructure project `new-api` is appended as the newest entry in the sponsor table across all four localized READMEs (`README.md`, `README_ZH.md`, `README_JA.md`, `README_DE.md`), along with its banner asset.

### Internal

- **Harden Release Supply Chain**: Added a `.github/CODEOWNERS` that, together with branch protection's Code Owners rule, requires owner review before any PR merges to `main` (with `/.github/` and `/src-tauri/` pinned explicitly alongside the global `*` fallback, all to `@farion1231`), gated the release job behind a `release` environment in `release.yml` so signing secrets unlock only after manual approval, and removed `.github` from `.gitignore` so the previously untracked `labeler.yml` and `workflows/labeler.yml` are now versioned.
- **Settle pnpm Build-Script Approvals**: Approved `esbuild` (via `onlyBuiltDependencies`) and ignored `msw` (via `ignoredBuiltDependencies`) in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so pnpm 10.13+ stops appending `allowBuilds` placeholders to the file on every install.
- **Platform-Gate the Desktop-Scope Assertion in the Profile Roundtrip Test**: The `profile_roundtrip` integration test's Claude Desktop assertion is now `cfg`-gated to macOS/Windows to match the already cfg-gated desktop switch, so on Linux CI (where desktop live writes error) it expects the seeded `d1` instead of `d2` and no longer panics, poisons the shared test mutex, and cascades into two more failures.

## [3.16.5] - 2026-07-01

Development since v3.16.4 reworks the Codex native-Responses path — restoring a generated model catalog for proxy-less direct-connect, decoupling model mapping from the local-routing toggle, and adding a host/model-prefix blacklist that disables Codex's built-in web_search on gateways that reject it — alongside a broad wave of new provider presets (Qiniu and Code0.ai across all seven apps, the FennoAI/ZetaAPI/TeamoRouter/NekoCode partners, and the non-partner Amux), Claude Sonnet 5 pricing plus a default-tier bump to it, a categorized two-level session view with group-level batch selection, live auto-sync of the shared Claude common config on switch, and a run of credential-safety, tool-detection, Doubao model-id, branding, and icon-size fixes.

**Stats**: 36 commits | 93 files changed | +5,678 insertions | -2,804 deletions

### Added

- **Codex Native Responses Direct-Connect Regenerates a Model Catalog**: Reverses the v3.16.4 direction that dropped the catalog — Codex providers now run in two explicit modes, and native direct-connect once again ships a catalog file. Providers with `apiFormat: "openai_responses"` run with no proxy, and cc-switch generates `~/.codex/cc-switch-model-catalog.json` (`CC_SWITCH_CODEX_MODEL_CATALOG_FILENAME`, provider id `custom`) so Codex Desktop actually shows the custom models and tools work without the freeform `apply_patch` (`type=custom`) tool that native gateways like MiMo reject — editing falls back to `shell_command`. Catalog generation is keyed on `apiFormat` via `CodexCatalogToolProfile` and decoupled from the route-takeover toggle, so a native provider persists a catalog without enabling local route mapping, while `openai_chat` keeps the existing Responses↔Chat proxy conversion unchanged. Codex's parser requires `base_instructions` on every entry, so the native template (`codex_native_responses_template.json`, slug `gpt-5.5`) carries a neutral default that per-vendor official text overrides (MiMo, MiniMax); synthesized catalogs for Qwen/Doubao/LongCat use the neutral default. Existing native providers must be re-saved once to regenerate a valid catalog (no DB migration).
- **Categorized Session View With Two-Level Grouping**: The Session Manager gains a grouped view mode alongside the flat list, toggled via a List/ListTree Select in the toolbar and persisted to `localStorage` under `cc-switch.sessionManager.listViewMode`. The new `groupSessionsByProviderAndDirectory` helper builds a two-level hierarchy (provider group → project-directory group): directory groups are keyed by `getSessionDirectoryGroupKey(providerId, projectDir)` and labeled with `getBaseName(projectDir)`, and sessions lacking a `projectDir` fall into an "unknown directory" bucket (`UNKNOWN_PROJECT_DIR_KEY = __unknown_project_dir__`). Both levels are Radix Collapsible sections whose expansion state is serialized to `cc-switch.sessionManager.groupExpansionState` (pruned to valid keys after load), with a "collapse all" button; in batch mode each group header gains a tri-state checkbox that selects/deselects every selectable session (those with a `sourcePath`) at once, backed by a `Minus`-glyph indeterminate state added to `ui/checkbox.tsx` and a selected/selectable count badge. New keys were added across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW). The change is entirely frontend — no Tauri commands or DAO changes. (#4776)
- **Qiniu (七牛云) Provider Preset Across All Seven Apps**: Added the Qiniu Cloud AI gateway as a partner aggregator spanning Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes — the widest coverage of the batch and the only one carrying a Gemini preset. Because Qiniu relays native Claude/GPT/Gemini rather than remapping to domestic models, Claude Code/Desktop use the Anthropic-compatible bare host with native passthrough (no model pinning), Codex hits native Responses at `https://api.qnaigc.com/bypass/openai/v1` defaulting to `gpt-5.5`, and Gemini uses `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` via `https://api.qnaigc.com/bypass/vertex`; OpenCode/OpenClaw/Hermes default to `gpt-5.5` over the OpenAI-compatible `/v1`. Each type carries `endpointCandidates` listing the `api.qnaigc.com` primary plus the `api.modelink.ai` overseas mirror for failover. It is marked `isPartner` with referral `https://s.qiniu.com/nMvAvy`, a localized display name via `nameKey` (`providerForm.presets.qiniu`) and a partner-promotion blurb in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), and registers the `qiniu.png` icon through URL import plus `iconUrls` and metadata.
- **FennoAI, ZetaAPI, and TeamoRouter Partner Presets**: Added three partner aggregators — FennoAI (`api.fenno.ai`), ZetaAPI (`api.zetaapi.ai`), and TeamoRouter (`api.teamorouter.com`) — each covering Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes with no Gemini preset, since these relay native Claude/GPT only. In every case Claude Code/Desktop use the Anthropic-compatible bare host with native passthrough, Codex uses native Responses (FennoAI at `api.fenno.ai`, ZetaAPI and TeamoRouter at their `/v1` paths) defaulting to `gpt-5.5`, and OpenCode/OpenClaw/Hermes default to `gpt-5.5` over the OpenAI-compatible `/v1`. All three are `isPartner` with referral `apiKeyUrls` (FennoAI's ¥9.9 Coding Plan link, ZetaAPI's `zetaapi.ai/go/ccs`, TeamoRouter's `teamorouter.com` with `utm_source=cc_switch` — its in-app link stays English while README links are per-language), each ships a localized promo blurb in zh/en/ja/zh-TW plus a sponsor row in all four READMEs, and each registers its own icon (`fenno-icon.webp`, `zetaapi-icon.png`, `teamorouter`). Two carry surfaced discount codes: ZetaAPI gives a first-recharge 10% discount with promo code `CC-SWITCH`, and TeamoRouter gives new users 10% off their first top-up.
- **Amux Aggregator Preset**: Added Amux (`api.amux.ai`) as a non-partner aggregator across Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, with no Gemini preset. Claude Code/Desktop use the bare Anthropic-compatible host, Codex uses native Responses over the `/v1` path, and the remaining three apps default to `gpt-5.5` over the OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Unlike the partner presets in this batch it carries no `isPartner` flag, referral link, or promo copy; the `amuxapi-icon.svg` is registered as an inline `currentColor` icon in `src/icons/extracted/index.ts` and `metadata.ts` rather than a raster URL import.
- **Code0.ai Partner Preset Across All Seven Apps**: Added Code0.ai (`code0.ai`) as a partner aggregator spanning all seven apps — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes. Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Gemini use the bare `https://code0.ai` host (Anthropic-native passthrough with no model pinning for the two Claude apps, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` for Gemini), Codex hits native Responses at `https://code0.ai/v1`, and OpenCode/OpenClaw/Hermes default to `gpt-5.5` over the OpenAI-compatible `/v1`. It is marked `isPartner` with a `?source=ccswitch` referral on the API-key signup link, a partner-promotion blurb surfacing the CC Switch test-credit offer in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), a sponsor row in all four READMEs, and the `code0.png` icon registered via URL import.
- **NekoCode Partner Preset Across Six Apps**: Added NekoCode (`nekocode.ai`) as a partner aggregator spanning six apps — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes (no Gemini preset). Claude Code and Claude Desktop use the bare `https://nekocode.ai` host (Anthropic-native passthrough with no model pinning), Codex hits native Responses at `https://nekocode.ai/v1`, and OpenCode/OpenClaw/Hermes default to `gpt-5.5` over the OpenAI-compatible `/v1`. It is marked `isPartner` with a `?aff=CCSWITCH` referral on the API-key signup link (kept off the actual request endpoints), a partner-promotion blurb in all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), and a sponsor row in all four READMEs, both surfacing the CC Switch offer — 10% off top-ups with promo code `cc-switch` at recharge. The `nekocode-icon.png` icon is registered via URL import.
- **Claude Sonnet 5 Model Pricing**: Seeded a `claude-sonnet-5` pricing row in `schema.rs` at Anthropic list price — $3/$15 per Mtok input/output and $0.30/$3.75 cache read/write, identical to the Sonnet 4.6 rates. The introductory $2/$10 promo (valid through 2026-08-31) is deliberately not seeded, so accounting reflects steady-state list pricing rather than a temporary discount. The row is applied on next app start via `ensure_model_pricing_seeded` and requires no `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump.

### Changed

- **Decoupled Codex Model Mapping From the Local-Routing Toggle**: Aligns the Codex provider form with Claude Code — the model-mapping catalog is now independent of route takeover, since native Responses providers (MiMo, Doubao, MiniMax) need it for proxy-less direct connect while Chat providers use the proxy regardless of any per-provider flag. The "Needs Local Routing" toggle is removed: it had no backend field and only gated catalog/reasoning persistence, which is equivalent to whether the mapping is filled. Model mapping is now always shown for non-official providers and persisted whenever the list is non-empty (the backend already keys off `modelCatalog.models`), while reasoning visibility/persistence is gated on the Chat format instead of the toggle. The Chat upstream-format option is marked "routing required" with a refreshed advanced-section hint across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), dead `localRouting*` keys are dropped, and the model-mapping block moves above the custom User-Agent block. Also fixes `useCodexConfigState` dropping `supportsParallelToolCalls`/`inputModalities`/`baseInstructions` when loading a saved provider — which silently lost parallel tools, image input, and the official base instructions on edit — by preserving them on load (camelCase and snake_case) and comparing them in the row sync.
- **Auto-Sync Claude Common Config From Live settings.json on Switch**: When switching away from a Claude provider that has `common_config_enabled`, the service now re-extracts the shareable portion of its live `settings.json` and replaces the stored common-config snippet, instead of only writing the snippet one way. This captures config the user added directly in the running app (`enabledPlugins`, `hooks`, `env`, `theme`, shared prefs) so it isn't silently lost on the next switch, and it propagates deletions so a removed key isn't re-injected later. The sync in `services/provider/mod.rs` is scoped strictly to Claude providers with `common_config_enabled`, is skipped when the snippet was explicitly cleared, and all failures are non-fatal (warn-only) and never block the switch. Four integration tests cover capture / delete-sync / opt-out / cleared.
- **Default Sonnet Tier Now Pins to Claude Sonnet 5**: Bumped every default Sonnet pin from `claude-sonnet-4-6`/`claude-sonnet-4.6` to `claude-sonnet-5` across all provider presets (`claudeProviderPresets`, `claudeDesktopProviderPresets`, `hermesProviderPresets`, `openclawProviderPresets`, `opencodeProviderPresets`, and universal `NEWAPI_DEFAULT_MODELS`), covering the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` env keys and prefixed variants like `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` and `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`. The Claude Desktop `DEFAULT_PROXY_ROUTES` sonnet `route_id` in `claude_desktop_config.rs` also moves to `claude-sonnet-5` (`supports_1m` preserved), and the route-derivation test expectations were updated to match. Non-Anthropic pins (gpt/gemini/glm/sonnet-4-5) were left untouched.
- **Doubao Dated Model Id and YYMMDD Pricing Normalization**: Switched the Doubao (DouBaoSeed) preset model id to the dated form `doubao-seed-2-1-pro-260628` across every app surface (config default, generated Codex catalog, and OpenClaw namespaced refs), because Volcengine Ark rejects the bare `doubao-seed-2-1-pro` with a 404 ("model does not exist or you do not have access to it") even after activation and only accepts the full dated id. Because real usage now arrives with a date suffix, `strip_model_date_suffix` in `usage_stats.rs` was extended to also strip Volcengine's 6-digit YYMMDD form (`-260628`, `-250615`) in addition to the existing 8-digit YYYYMMDD/ISO handling; the 6-digit branch validates month 01-12 and day 01-31 to avoid eating non-date version suffixes like `-123456`, then falls back to `None` for exact matching. This keeps the bare-name seed row as the canonical pricing identity, fixing the $0-cost display for every Volcengine Doubao model. Unit and end-to-end regression tests were added.
- **"Write Common Config" Renamed to "Apply Common Config"**: The original label "Write Common Config" (写入通用配置) was ambiguous about data-flow direction, reading as "write the current config INTO the common config" when the actual behavior is the reverse — the saved common-config snippet is merged INTO this provider's config. The checkbox is renamed to "Apply Common Config" across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW), including every hint/guide/notice reference and the `CommonConfigEditor` / `GeminiConfigSections` defaultValue fallbacks, and the Gemini hint wording is aligned with the claude/codex "when checked" phrasing. The Japanese user manual (`docs/user-manual/ja/2-providers/2.1-add.md`) and `README_JA.md` were also synced to 共通設定を適用 / 共有設定を適用. (#4829)
- **OpenClaw Doubao Context Window Aligned to 262144**: The OpenClaw DouBaoSeed preset hard-coded `contextWindow` 128000 while the Codex preset/catalog used 262144 for the same model, giving OpenClaw users a too-small window that could compress or truncate long context prematurely. Bumped `openclawProviderPresets.ts` to 262144 and added a cross-preset consistency test asserting the OpenClaw and Codex Doubao context windows stay equal so the two sides cannot silently drift apart again.
- **Volcengine/Doubao/BytePlus Website Links Restored to Official Homepages**: The `websiteUrl` for the 火山Agentplan, BytePlus, and DouBaoSeed presets had accidentally been set to the same invite/console link as `apiKeyUrl`, so the "visit official site" button routed users to the referral/API-key page instead of the product homepage. Restored clean official homepages across all six app preset files — 火山Agentplan to `https://www.volcengine.com/product/ark`, DouBaoSeed to `https://www.volcengine.com/product/doubao`, and BytePlus to `https://www.byteplus.com/en/product/modelark` (dropping the utm params) — while leaving the `apiKeyUrl` referral links intact.
- **Kimi and SiliconFlow Referral Links Refreshed**: Updated two sponsor referral sets across presets and READMEs. Following Moonshot's console rebrand to Kimi, the Kimi preset referral links and the domestic (ZH) README banner moved to the new `platform.kimi.com` domain — the domestic console `platform.moonshot.cn/console` → `platform.kimi.com`, the API-key page → `platform.kimi.com/console/api-keys`, and the Coding Plan link `www.kimi.com/code/docs/` → `www.kimi.com/code/` — and the missing `?aff=cc-switch` attribution param was added to the codex and openclaw entries. API endpoints (`api.moonshot.cn`, `api.kimi.com/coding`) were left unchanged, and the presets have no overseas variant (the separate EN/DE/JA README switch to `platform.kimi.ai` is covered under Docs below). Separately, the SiliconFlow invite code was rotated from `drGuwc9k` to `YflgU2Ve` across all README locales and the claude, claude-desktop, codex, hermes, and openclaw presets.
- **Downscaled Oversized Provider Icons to 256px**: Shrank a batch of bundled provider icons that shipped far larger than their ~32px on-screen render size in `ProviderIcon`, cutting bundle weight with no code, filename, or import changes (aspect ratio preserved, rendered via `<img>` object-contain). Raster PNGs: ZetaAPI 1254×1254/940KB→40KB, relaxcode 1462×1076/1.16MB→42KB, sudocode 2048×2048/432KB→37KB, hermes 512×512/125KB→38KB, claudecn 512×512/109KB→46KB, atlascloud 3525×3300/105KB→9KB. Two "fake vector" SVGs wrapping a single oversized base64 PNG were re-embedded at a 256px max dimension keeping the SVG wrapper: ccsub 1.16MB→60KB and shengsuanyun 212KB→51KB. Also removed `dds.svg`, a 1.4MB genuine 2222-path vector that was never imported in `index.ts` nor referenced under `src/`, so it only bloated the repo without ever shipping.

### Fixed

- **Disable web_search for Native Codex Gateways That Reject It**: Some native `/responses` gateways whose first-party models lack OpenAI's hosted `web_search` tool reject it with "tool type 'web_search' is not supported by this gateway phase" (`responses_feature_not_supported`), and Codex sends the tool by default (config-driven, not gated by the catalog's `supports_search_tool`), producing hard 400s. cc-switch now writes the top-level TOML line `web_search = "disabled"` for those vendors via `set_codex_native_web_search_field`, injected alongside `model_catalog_json` at switch time. Scope is a blacklist (default-on): only providers matched by `base_url` host — `CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_REJECT_HOSTS = xiaomimimo.com, longcat.chat, minimax.io, minimaxi.com` — or by model brand prefix — `CODEX_WEB_SEARCH_REJECT_MODEL_PREFIXES = mimo, longcat, minimax, qwen3-coder` — are disabled, so relays serving real GPT, DouBao, general Qwen, and any unknown provider keep Codex's default. The `qwen3-coder` prefix suppresses the tool for the native `qwen3-coder-plus` direct-connect preset (百炼/DashScope marks built-in tools unsupported for the coder series) while general Qwen models sharing the DashScope host stay enabled — matching is on the model axis (after stripping any aggregator `vendor/` path segment like `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` or `qwen/qwen3-coder-plus`), so it also catches aggregators such as SiliconFlow fronting a reject vendor's model. A blacklist was chosen over a fuzzy "is this GPT?" whitelist because wrongly keeping `web_search` ON fails with a hard 400, and an ownership sentinel means cc-switch only ever removes a `web_search` key whose value equals its own `disabled`, so existing providers need no re-save and switching back re-enables web search. Also corrects the LongCat-2.0-Preview preset context window from 131072 (128K) to its real 1048576 (1M), aligning with the MiMo/Qwen 2^20 convention, and tightens the native Responses preset tests to assert exact model→contextWindow catalogs instead of only checking catalog presence.
- **Strip All Credential-Like Keys From the Shared Claude Common-Config Snippet**: `extract_claude_common_config` previously only redacted `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, but Claude providers legitimately carry other credentials (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and possibly OpenAI/Gemini/AWS Bedrock/Vertex secrets), which could leak into the shared snippet and then be injected into other providers. Extraction now pattern-matches and strips any credential-shaped env key (`*_API_KEY` / `*_AUTH_TOKEN` / `*secret*` / `*token*`, etc.), while preserving plural `*_TOKENS` values like `MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` as legitimately shareable. This also closes the same pre-existing leak in the manual Extract and one-time auto-extract paths, and is covered by a dedicated credential-stripping unit test.
- **Usage-Script Credentials Persisted Only as Explicit Overrides**: Provider usage scripts store optional `api_key`/`base_url` fields that override the provider's live credentials when querying quota, but these were silently mirroring the provider's own credentials — so copying a provider or editing its main API key/base URL left the usage script pinned to the old endpoint and key, and quota queries kept hitting the stale target. `ProviderService::add`/`update` now run `normalize_usage_script_credential_overrides` before persisting: if the script's trimmed `api_key` or slash-normalized `base_url` matches the provider's resolved usage credentials (or is blank) it is cleared to `None` so the query falls back to `resolve_usage_credentials` from the live config, while genuinely distinct overrides are kept and `template_type == "token_plan"` scripts are left untouched. The deeplink import path gained matching `normalize_deeplink_api_key`/`base_url` helpers, and the frontend now invalidates `usageKeys.script(id, appId)` (including the `originalId` when a provider is renamed) on update so the homepage re-queries with the corrected config instead of the test-time cache. (#4654)
- **Hermes Config Dir Now Resolves Correctly on Windows**: CC Switch hardcoded `~/.hermes` as the Hermes config directory, but Hermes itself resolves it via `get_hermes_home()` — the `HERMES_HOME` env var, then a platform default of `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on Windows (`~/.hermes` on mac/Linux). On Windows this meant CC Switch wrote provider configs to a path Hermes never reads, so provider switches had no effect. `get_hermes_dir()` now mirrors Hermes' own resolution order — `settings.hermes_config_dir` explicit override, then `HERMES_HOME` taken verbatim (trimmed, non-empty, no `~` expansion, matching Hermes' `Path(val)`), then the platform default reading the actual `LOCALAPPDATA` env var (falling back to `~\AppData\Local\hermes`) on Windows and `~/.hermes` elsewhere. This deliberately re-honors the `HERMES_HOME` that #3470 had dropped, since unlike Codex/Claude the Hermes Windows installer sets `HERMES_HOME` as a first-class mechanism for relocated installs. Config-dir tests were also isolated from ambient `HERMES_HOME`/`LOCALAPPDATA`. (#4680, refs #3178, #3470)
- **Linux Wayland: Override the AppImage's Forced `GDK_BACKEND=x11`**: The AppImage's GTK launch hook (`linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk.sh`) unconditionally exports `GDK_BACKEND=x11` to dodge a historical native-Wayland crash (tauri-apps/tauri#8541). On newer Wayland + NVIDIA setups this forced XWayland leaves the WebKitGTK web content unable to receive pointer events — the GTK title bar stays clickable but the page is dead — and black-screens on resize; the existing `WEBKIT_DISABLE_*` mitigations don't help because the root cause is the forced window backend, not rendering. Since the hook also overrides any user-set `GDK_BACKEND`, there was no way to switch back without unpacking the AppImage. `main.rs` now reads an opt-in `CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND` escape hatch (which the hook never touches) before GTK init: leaving it unset keeps the current x11 behavior unchanged (zero regression), while `CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND=wayland` forces native Wayland. The override is generic, so users on tiling Wayland compositors hitting the inverse input bug can set `CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND=x11`. (#4351, fixes #4350)
- **Get API Key Link Now Shows in Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, and Hermes Forms**: The "Get API Key" link and partner-promotion block below the API key input was only wired for claude/codex/gemini/opencode. Claude Desktop rendered a bare Input that never showed it, and OpenClaw/Hermes were blocked by two gaps: `useApiKeyLink` whitelisted only those four appIds (so the link was suppressed even when a preset carried `apiKeyUrl`), and `useProviderCategory` only parsed the `/^(claude|codex|gemini|opencode)-(\d+)$/` preset-id pattern (so OpenClaw/Hermes category stayed undefined and the cn_official/aggregator/third_party link condition never held). `ClaudeDesktopProviderForm` now calls `useApiKeyLink` and uses the shared `ApiKeySection`; the `useApiKeyLink` whitelist and its `PresetEntry` union add claude-desktop/openclaw/hermes; and `useProviderCategory` now resolves openclaw/hermes preset categories. Additionally, `HermesFormFields` and `OpenClawFormFields` no longer let an "official" category disable the key input, since these apps have no OAuth-only official providers (e.g. Hermes' Nous Research is official but still needs a user-supplied key).
- **Deduplicated Windows Codex npm Shims in Tool Detection**: On Windows, npm installs a tool as three sibling files — `codex.cmd`, `codex.exe`, and an extensionless Unix shim named `codex` — and CC Switch's `tool_executable_candidates` listed all three, so the extensionless shim (which Windows cannot execute directly) was probed as a redundant/failing candidate. `tool_executable_candidates` now appends the extensionless path only when `windows_runnable_sibling_for_extensionless_tool` finds no adjacent `.cmd`/`.exe` sibling, and `resolve_path_default` likewise prefers a runnable `.cmd`/`.exe` sibling before canonicalizing a bare extensionless PATH hit. This keeps version detection and launching anchored to the actually-runnable Windows shim instead of the shadowed Unix one. (#4782)
- **Scroll Bounds for Long Select Dropdowns**: The `SelectContent` popover used `overflow-hidden` with no height cap, so dropdowns with many options (e.g. long model or provider lists) rendered taller than the viewport and clipped their overflowing items with no way to reach them. It now sets `max-h-[min(24rem,var(--radix-select-content-available-height))]` and `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden`, bounding the content to 24rem or the Radix-computed available height and letting the list scroll vertically while still clipping horizontally. (#4798)
- **Date-Range Picker Calendar Stays On-Screen in Narrow Popovers**: The custom date-range picker switched to its two-column layout (date fields | calendar) based on the viewport width via Tailwind's `sm:` (640px) breakpoint, but the popover is clamped to `100vw - 2rem` and anchored to its trigger with `align="end"`, so its real available width is narrower than the viewport. On narrow windows the two-column layout could activate while the popover only had room for one column, pushing the calendar column off the right edge where it was clipped — the month header and 4 of 7 weekday columns cut off and unreachable. The layout now keys off the popover's own inline size via a CSS container query (`w-[620px] max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`) instead of the viewport, so it collapses to one column exactly when the popover itself is narrow, keeping the calendar fully visible at any window width. (#4860)

### Docs

- **Documented the `CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND` Escape Hatch in README and User Manual**: Added an FAQ entry for the opt-in `CC_SWITCH_GDK_BACKEND` environment variable (see the corresponding Fixed entry) across all four README locales (`README.md`, `README_ZH.md`, `README_JA.md`, `README_DE.md`) and the zh/en/ja user-manual troubleshooting pages (`docs/user-manual/{zh,en,ja}/5-faq/5.2-questions.md`), explaining how Wayland + NVIDIA users can switch back to native Wayland when the webview goes click-dead and black-screens on resize, and how tiling-Wayland users can set it to `x11` for the inverse input bug.
- **Overseas Kimi READMEs Point to platform.kimi.ai With a Coding Plan Link**: Updated the Kimi K2.7 Code partner section across the English, German, and Japanese READMEs so the banner image and both inline CTAs point to `https://platform.kimi.ai?aff=cc-switch` instead of the old `platform.kimi.com` host, keeping the `aff=cc-switch` referral tag intact. All four localized READMEs (`README.md`, `README_DE.md`, `README_JA.md`, `README_ZH.md`) also gained a new line promoting the Kimi For Coding subscription plan linked to `https://www.kimi.com/code/?aff=cc-switch`; note the ZH README kept its existing `platform.kimi.com` link and only received the Coding Plan addition.
- **GitHub Global Top-100 Milestone Banner in v3.16.4 Release Notes**: Prepended a celebratory callout blockquote to all three localized v3.16.4 release notes (`docs/release-notes/v3.16.4-en.md`, `-ja.md`, `-zh.md`) announcing that CC Switch has entered the global top 100 GitHub projects by star count, thanking users, contributors, and stargazers. This is a docs-only addition to the release-notes header and does not change any product behavior.

## [3.16.4] - 2026-06-27

Development since v3.16.3 focuses on tightening the Codex proxy path — native OpenAI Responses migration for the major Chinese providers, a decoupled upstream-format selector, zstd request/error-body decompression, and a run of tool-call and OAuth-over-proxy fixes — alongside richer usage and pricing tooling (models.dev pricing import, Volcengine Ark coding/agent-plan quotas, live-tracking date ranges, GLM-5.2/Doubao Seed 2.1 pricing), new proxy and resilience capabilities (custom request header/body overrides, an in-app recovery screen for too-new databases, native Windows ARM64 builds), and a broad wave of preset and branding updates (the SubRouter and OpenCode Go subscriptions, the CTok→ETok rename, Kimi rebranding and prime-partner badges, and a Kimi K2.7 Code sponsor banner).

**Stats**: 53 commits | 126 files changed | +8,149 insertions | -1,016 deletions

### Added

- **In-App Recovery Screen for a Too-New Database**: When the SQLite `user_version` is newer than the app supports (`SCHEMA_VERSION`) — e.g. after a downgrade or because a third-party client wrote the file — startup used to dead-end in a native Retry/Exit dialog where Retry just failed again. The app now boots a dedicated recovery screen offering an in-place "Upgrade app" button (download + install + restart with a progress bar) when an update is available, or a warning that even the latest build can't read the database when none is. The too-new check runs before any schema writes so the app never runs DDL against a database it can't understand, and native-close quits cleanly in recovery mode where no tray exists. (#4575)
- **Local Proxy Request Overrides (Custom Headers and Body)**: Provider configs can now define custom request headers and request-body overrides that the local proxy applies when forwarding, exposed via a new field in the Claude and Codex provider forms. Inputs are validated, including a protected-header-name list that blocks overriding security-sensitive headers. (#4589)
- **Volcengine Ark Coding/Agent Plan Usage Query**: Usage panels can now query coding-plan and agent-plan quota for Volcengine Ark. Because the Ark control-plane OpenAPI (`open.volcengineapi.com`) requires account-level AccessKey signing rather than the inference API key, the usage script gains a dedicated AK/SK input block, with a clickable link straight to the Volcengine IAM key-management console (`https://console.volcengine.com/iam/keymanage`), and the proxy implements Volcengine Signature V4 (an AWS SigV4 variant with fixed canonical header order, `HMAC-SHA256` algorithm, and `ark` service scope). It auto-detects the plan by probing `GetAFPUsage` (Agent Plan five-hour/weekly/monthly quotas) before falling back to `GetCodingPlanUsage`, parses the window label from the `Level` field (guarding `ResetTimestamp <= 0`), and adds a `monthly` tier label across the footer, tray menu, and all four locales.
- **Import Model Pricing from models.dev**: The Add Pricing panel gains an "Import from models.dev" button that fetches `https://models.dev/api.json`, lets users full-text search the catalog, and imports the selected entry through the same `update_model_pricing` path as manual entry. Imported model IDs are normalized to match the backend's `clean_model_id_for_pricing` rules (strip vendor prefix, lowercase, drop `:` suffix, map `@` to `-`, drop the `[1m]` marker) so stored rows actually match cost-attribution lookups. A companion fix makes the scoped zero-cost backfill match raw model aliases (route prefixes, `:free` variants, date suffixes) in Rust instead of by exact SQL string, so newly priced alias rows get costed immediately rather than waiting for the next startup backfill (Fixes #4017). (#4079)
- **Windows ARM64 Release Builds**: Releases now include native Windows ARM64 artifacts so ARM-based Windows devices get a matching build instead of relying on x64 emulation. The release matrix also runs each platform independently (fail-fast disabled) so a missing-secret failure on one job — e.g. macOS signing in forks — no longer cancels its siblings before they finish. (#3950)
- **Live End Time for Custom Date Ranges**: The custom date-range picker gains an "End time follows current time" checkbox; when enabled the end time becomes read-only and tracks the current moment, so usage data always reflects up-to-the-second consumption from the chosen start. This is especially useful for watching real-time token use within a Coding Plan 5-hour quota window. `liveEndTime` is included in the React Query cache keys so a live range and a fixed range with the same stored endpoints no longer collide on a stale cache entry. (#4438)
- **Source File Name in Session Detail Header**: The session detail header now shows the session log's file name (with the full path on hover and click-to-copy) alongside the project directory, so users can locate and open the underlying JSONL file directly from the UI. Long, space-less basenames such as ~70-char Codex rollout files are truncated at `max-w-[200px]` to keep them from overflowing into the action-button area on narrow windows. (#4113)
- **Unmanaged-Skill Indicator on Import Button**: The top-bar Skills Import button now shows a green dot with a tooltip when local unmanaged skills are available to import, so you can tell at a glance that on-disk skills aren't tracked yet. The scan runs once on mount and is shared across navigations (30s `staleTime` + `keepPreviousData`) to avoid repeated disk IO.
- **OpenCode Go Subscription Presets**: New OpenCode Go (`opencode.ai/zen/go`) presets for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode, authenticated with a plain pasteable API key (no OAuth). The Codex preset uses `openai_chat` conversion with a GLM/Kimi/DeepSeek/MiMo model catalog (and no static `codexChatReasoning`, so per-model capability is inferred), while OpenCode targets `/zen/go/v1` via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`. All four OpenCode Go presets — Claude, Claude Desktop, Codex, and OpenCode — carry a referral link and an in-app promo phrase; the promo banner is now gated on `partnerPromotionKey` alone rather than `isPartner`, so a preset can show a referral promo without earning the gold paid-partner star (this also re-surfaces the existing MiniMax promos).
- **SubRouter Partner Provider**: Added SubRouter (`subrouter.ai`), an AI relay aggregator that exposes many models and providers behind a single key, as a preset across all seven managed apps — the Anthropic-format endpoint for Claude Code / Claude Desktop / OpenClaw / Hermes, the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint with `gpt-5.5` for Codex and OpenCode, and the Gemini-compatible `/v1beta` endpoint with `gemini-3.5-flash` for Gemini CLI — carrying its own brand icon, the gold partner star, four-locale promotion copy, and the affiliate registration link (`?aff=l3ri`) prefilled as the API-key signup URL. (#4522)
- **Prime-Partner Preset Badge and Ordering**: First-party Moonshot Kimi presets (Kimi / Kimi For Coding / Kimi K2.7 Code) are now flagged as prime partners: instead of the gold star, they render a solid gold heart with no badge frame, and in the default (Original) sort they float to the top right after official-category presets, ahead of the rest. Grouping is a three-way partition so each group keeps its internal order and an official preset also flagged prime-partner stays only in the official group.
- **Pricing for GLM-5.2 and Doubao Seed 2.1**: Seed model pricing now includes GLM-5.2 (#4385) and Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro/Turbo, so usage from these models is cost-attributed correctly instead of recording zero cost. Doubao prices use Volcengine's official list price (CNY converted at ~7.14); `cache_creation` is kept at 0 because Doubao bills cache storage by time rather than per-token writes, and the existing 2.0 rows are retained for historical accounting.
- **Kimi For Coding Auto-Compact Window**: The Kimi For Coding preset now sets `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` to a default of 262144 to match the official Kimi docs, exposed via `templateValues` so users can customize the value for future models or performance tuning. (#4401)

### Changed

- **Native Responses API for CN Codex Providers**: Several Chinese providers (Qwen/DashScope Bailian, Xiaomi MiMo, Volcengine Doubao, Meituan LongCat, MiniMax CN/intl) now expose a native OpenAI Responses endpoint, so their Codex presets switch to `apiFormat: "openai_responses"` and reach the upstream directly instead of going through the Responses->Chat route-takeover conversion. Dropping the now-unused `codexChatReasoning` and `modelCatalog` also keeps the "local route mapping" toggle unchecked by default. SiliconFlow-hosted MiniMax stays `openai_chat` since it is a third-party endpoint rather than MiniMax's own base_url. Stale model ids on the remaining chat-only providers were refreshed as well (GLM 5.1->5.2, StepFun 3.5-flash-2603->3.7-flash, Ling 2.5-1T->2.6-1T).
- **Decoupled Upstream Format Selector from Model-Mapping Toggle**: The Codex provider form used to tie Chat-format conversion and route takeover (model mapping) to a single toggle, so a provider serving a native Responses API could not use model mapping without forcing Chat Completions conversion. The upstream format (Chat Completions / Responses) is now an independent, always-visible selector, while the local-routing toggle solely gates the advanced sub-sections (model mapping catalog, plus reasoning capability when the format is Chat). Its initial state is derived from saved catalog presence with no new persisted field, and the `codexConfig` i18n strings were reworded across all four locales (zh/en/ja/zh-TW).
- **Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro Preset**: The DouBaoSeed preset now targets `doubao-seed-2-1-pro` (replacing `doubao-seed-2-0-code-preview-latest`) across all six clients (claude, claude-desktop, codex, opencode, openclaw, hermes), with display names updated to "Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro" and the OpenClaw cost field corrected from 0.002/0.006 to 0.84/4.2 USD per 1M tokens to match the new model.
- **CTok Rebranded to ETok**: Following the vendor's domain, endpoint, and trademark rename, all user-facing branding moves from CTok to ETok (`ctok.ai` -> `etok.ai`, `api.ctok.ai` -> `api.etok.ai`, internal id, display name, icons, and README partner banners) across every client preset. The Codex history-migration whitelist keeps `ctok` as a legacy id alongside the new `etok` so existing users' local session history stays correctly bucketed after the rename.
- **Consistent Kimi Preset Naming**: The OpenCode and OpenClaw Kimi presets, previously labeled "Kimi K2.7 Code", are renamed to plain "Kimi" (along with the OpenCode provider display name) to match the other apps; the model label stays "Kimi K2.7 Code" since it describes the actual model.
- **Dark Mode for JSON Editors**: The CodeMirror `JsonEditor` in the usage-script modal, provider form, and universal provider form now follows the app theme via `useDarkMode()`, switching to the `oneDark` editor theme instead of staying light while the rest of the app is dark. (#4556)
- **Tighter Add Provider Header With Footer Hint**: The Add Provider dialog reduces the title-to-tabs and tabs-to-card vertical gaps from 24px to 12px and adds an always-visible pinned footer hint guiding users to fill in the fields below after choosing a preset. `FullScreenPanel` gains an optional `contentClassName` prop so the padding override is scoped to this panel without affecting others that share it.
- **Theme-Adaptive Kimi Logo**: The inline Kimi placeholder mark is replaced with the vendor's refreshed logo. The K glyph uses `currentColor` so it follows the theme text color (dark in light mode, white in dark mode), while the brand accent dot is pinned to the new `#1783FF`, with the metadata fallback color aligned accordingly.
- **Fable 5 Verified Banner Removed**: The Settings About page no longer shows the Fable 5 Verified commemorative banner that 3.16.3 added beside the app name to mark the special build; the banner image and its markup are dropped, returning the About panel to its standard version-badge layout.

### Fixed

- **Copilot/Codex OAuth Requests Now Honor the Global Proxy**: `CopilotAuthManager` and `CodexOAuthManager` hardcoded `Client::new()` at construction, so their auth flows (token exchange, `/models` listing, model-vendor checks, device-code and OAuth-refresh requests) ignored the configured global proxy and connected directly. With Copilot the direct connection returned zero Claude models, breaking live model resolution and causing the upstream to reject requests with `400 model_not_supported`. Both managers now fetch the shared client per request via `crate::proxy::http_client::get()`, so they follow the global proxy URL and pick up runtime proxy changes. Fixes #2016, #2931. (#4583)
- **Compressed Request and Error Body Decompression**: Codex Desktop sends zstd-compressed request bodies when authenticated against the Codex backend, which broke local proxy routing because the handlers parsed the raw compressed bytes with `serde_json` directly. The proxy now decompresses request bodies (gzip/br/deflate plus new zstd support, including stacked codings like `gzip, zstd`) before JSON parsing across the three Codex handlers and strips the stale `content-encoding`/`content-length`/`transfer-encoding` headers so the forwarder regenerates them. Upstream non-2xx error bodies are decompressed the same way, so compressed rate-limit and auth details are no longer dropped and hidden from the client. Fixes #3764, #3696. (#3817)
- **DeepSeek Endpoint `thinking: disabled` 400 Errors**: DeepSeek's Anthropic-compatible endpoint rejects requests where `thinking.type=disabled` coexists with effort parameters, returning HTTP 400, which broke Claude Code 2.1.166+ sub-agents (Workflow/Dynamic Workflow) that hardcode `thinking: disabled`. Rather than overriding the client's intent, the proxy now strips the conflicting `output_config.effort` / `reasoning_effort` parameters for the official DeepSeek endpoint, since sub-agents don't need to display reasoning. (#4239)
- **Reverted Anthropic System-Message Hoisting**: Reverts #3775's hoisting of `role=system` messages out of `messages[]` into the top-level `system` field for Anthropic-compatible providers. DeepSeek's endpoint accepts inline system messages natively, and the rewrite altered the request prefix; leaving the messages in place preserves the prompt prefix and avoids a suspected cache hit-rate regression (refs #4297). The unrelated Windows test fixes and the tool-thinking-history normalization from #3775 are kept. (#3775)
- **Chat Tool Calls with Missing Function Names**: Some upstreams send empty or absent function names in streaming tool-call deltas, which previously produced invalid Codex Chat output items (or an `unknown_tool` fallback). Accumulated tool-call state is no longer overwritten by empty deltas, and tool calls that never receive both a `call_id` and a valid name are skipped at finalization across the streaming, non-streaming, and legacy `function_call` paths. (#4159)
- **Restored Cached Codex Tool Call Fields**: When Codex sends a follow-up Chat request referencing `previous_response_id`, its `function_call` items can arrive carrying only `call_id`. The history enrichment previously refilled only `reasoning`/`reasoning_content`, leaving the function `name`, `arguments`, `status`, and related fields empty; it now restores all cached tool-call fields from history so the call is reconstructed correctly for the Chat upstream. (#4160)
- **Duplicate Codex base_url Entries in config.toml**: Writing the Codex `base_url` into `config.toml` only replaced or removed a single matching assignment per section, so a section that already contained multiple `base_url` lines kept the extras and accumulated duplicates. `setCodexBaseUrl` now collapses all matches in the target section or top level (replacing the first and removing the rest), and the TOML `base_url` regex handles escaped quotes. (#4316)
- **CODEX_SQLITE_HOME State DB Probing for History Migration**: The Codex session-history migration only scanned `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite` and the `config.toml` `sqlite_home` location, so when Codex's SQLite state was relocated via the `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` env var the state DB was never scanned and its threads kept their old provider bucket. The shared `codex_state_db_paths` helper used by both the third-party and unified-session migrations now falls back to `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` (config `sqlite_home` still takes precedence).
- **Provider Terminals Respect the User's Shell**: Launching a provider terminal on macOS/Linux hardcoded `bash`, so zsh/fish users' rc files never loaded. The launchers now detect the user's default shell from `$SHELL` (falling back to `/bin/zsh` on macOS, `/bin/bash` on Linux) and exec into it with clean-start flags, while the launch scripts themselves run through POSIX `sh` for portability (e.g. fish, NixOS where `/bin/sh` may not exist). (#4140, fixes #1546)
- **Claude MCP Path Honors Custom Config Dir**: When a custom Claude config directory is configured, MCP server reads and writes now resolve to that directory's MCP file instead of the default location, keeping MCP state isolated per profile. The previous copy-on-access migration of the legacy file was removed in favor of resolving the override path directly. (#3431)
- **Preset Search Results Clickable After Searching**: After searching in the Add Provider preset selector, results could no longer be clicked or selected. The `requestAnimationFrame` `select()` that raced with typing (and ate the first character, e.g. "gateway" -> "ateway") is removed, input autofocus is restored for the open-by-click path, and refocus is wired up for the Ctrl/Cmd+F shortcut while the box is open. The provider-list typing guard is also scoped to the Ctrl/Cmd+F branch so Escape still closes the search panel. (#4315)
- **Skills Browser and Provider Card Display Fixes**: Fixed several display and interaction issues: the repo-manager action stays available while browsing skills.sh and Refresh stays available even when a repo returns no results; long provider names and website URLs on the provider card now truncate instead of overflowing; the OMO model-variant dropdown truncates its selected label with a full-text tooltip; and Select menu items show a checkmark on the active option. (#4323)
- **Settings Scroll Resets on Tab Switch**: Switching tabs in the Settings dialog kept the previous tab's scroll position, sometimes landing partway down the new tab; the scroll container now resets to the top whenever the active tab changes. (#4165)

### Docs

- **Kimi Pinned Sponsor Banner**: The pinned sponsor banner at the top of all four README locales (en/zh/ja/de) now features Kimi K2.7 Code in place of the previous MiniMax M2.7 banner. The copy reflects the K2.7 Code release (a coding-focused agentic model that reduces thinking-token usage roughly 30% versus K2.6), the banner is served from in-repo assets (`assets/partners/banners/kimi-banner-en.png` / `kimi-banner-zh.png`) instead of the Moonshot CDN, and a clickable call-to-action links to the `aff=cc-switch` Moonshot console.
- **Codex Unified Session-History Guide**: New trilingual (zh/en/ja) guide for the unified Codex session-history toggle, explaining what opt-in migration (on enable) and ledger-based restore (on disable) actually do, why session data is never truly deleted (tag-only rewrite plus automatic backups), and how to verify files on disk versus merely being filed under another provider drawer. It includes a symptom reference table for the common "my sessions are gone" misunderstanding plus on-disk verification commands for macOS/Linux/Windows, and is linked as the lead item in the v3.16.3 "Usage Guides" release notes.
- **Simplified Homebrew Install Instructions**: The installation guide no longer instructs users to run `brew tap farion1231/ccswitch` before `brew install --cask cc-switch`; the deprecated tap step was removed from the en/ja/zh user manuals so the cask installs directly. (#4319)
- **Star-History Global Rank Badge**: Added a star-history global rank badge next to the existing Trendshift badge in all four README locales, with light/dark theme variants.
- **Volcengine Coding Plan Campaign Link**: The "中国大陆地区的开发者请点击这里" link in the ByteDance/Volcengine sponsor entry now points to the Volcengine `ai618` campaign page instead of the previous `codingplan` referral URL, updated across all four README locales.
- **CCSub Sponsor Banner Vector Asset**: Replaced the low-res `ccsub.jpg` sponsor logo with a vector `ccsub.svg`, letterboxed from 2046x648 to 2046x850 (~2.406:1) so it matches the other sponsor-table banners and renders at the same 62px height. All four README locales point at the new asset.

## [3.16.3] - 2026-06-14

Development since v3.16.2 focuses on getting usage accounting right end-to-end — billing route-takeover and format-conversion traffic by the real upstream model and pricing basis (schema v11), counting Claude Code Workflow sub-agent sessions, folding Claude Desktop into the Claude view, refreshing the model pricing seed, and reworking the usage dashboard with global provider/model filters, brand-icon toolbars, and far more resilient quota queries — while hardening the proxy (mislabeled SSE bodies, Codex image rectification, OAuth token and takeover-residue recovery, Hermes duplicate YAML keys), reworking provider configuration (a custom User-Agent override, a unified Codex advanced section, searchable preset selection, a Fable 5 tier, and refreshed Kimi/Unity2/Volcengine/MiniMax presets), and smoothing the update, About-panel, and provider-health experiences.

**Stats**: 59 commits | 130 files changed | +10,223 insertions | -4,232 deletions

### Added

- **Custom User-Agent Override**: Provider configs can now set a custom User-Agent that the proxy applies consistently across request forwarding, stream check, and model listing (`GET /v1/models`), so coding-plan upstreams that gate on UA no longer fail detection or return 403 while the proxy itself works. The Claude and Codex forms expose it in advanced settings with a curated presets dropdown (Claude Code / Kilo Code families that pass UA whitelists) and live non-blocking validation; stale custom UAs are dropped when switching to an official preset to avoid silently altering headers (#3671).
- **Unified Codex Session History**: Official Codex sessions can now share a single resume-history bucket with cc-switch third-party sessions via an opt-in toggle under Settings → Codex App Enhancements, so the resume picker no longer hides them from each other. When enabled, the live `config.toml` routes official runs through a shared `custom` model_provider that mirrors the built-in OpenAI provider (`auth.json` is untouched); the toggle is forward-only by default but the enable dialog offers a checkbox to migrate existing official sessions (with per-generation backups), and the disable dialog offers a precise ledger-based restore that only reverts sessions originally recorded as `openai` while leaving sessions created during the toggle untouched.
- **Dashboard-Wide Provider/Model Filters**: The provider and model filters move from inside the request-log table up to the top bar, applying globally to the hero summary, trend chart, request logs, and both stats tabs so you can scope the whole dashboard to a given source and model. Sources match by exact display name (so session placeholder rows like "Claude (Session)" are selectable) and models match by effective pricing model, with the model dropdown cascading from the selected source and both lists showing only options that have data in the current range.
- **Refreshed Model Pricing Seed**: Added pricing for 9 models including Claude Fable 5, Grok 4.3, Mistral Medium 3.5 / Small 4, and Qwen 3.7 Max/Plus, and corrected 28 existing prices against current official vendor list pricing (GLM, Grok, MiMo, Doubao, Kimi, MiniMax, Mistral, Qwen) so usage cost estimates are accurate. Each change updates the seed for fresh installs and adds a guarded repair for existing databases without clobbering user-edited rows.
- **Claude Fable 5 Model Tier**: Provider forms now expose `claude-fable-5` as a fourth model-mapping tier on both the Claude Code and Claude Desktop proxy paths, with a fable → opus → default fallback mirroring the official downgrade and the `fable-` prefix whitelisted for the Desktop 1.12603.1+ validator. A clarified four-language fallback hint warns that leaving a tier blank on third-party endpoints forwards the literal model name and 404s (#3980, #4026, #4049).
- **Unity2.ai Partner Provider**: Added Unity2.ai, an AI API relay partner, as a preset across all seven managed apps (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, Hermes), each carrying the referral signup link and partner promotion copy in all four locales. Codex uses the bare base URL (the gateway exposes `/responses` at root) while OpenCode / OpenClaw / Hermes use the `/v1` chat-completions endpoint with `gpt-5.5`.
- **Kimi K2.7 Code Model**: Added the `kimi-k2.7-code` model (in $0.95 / out $4.00 / cache-read $0.19 per 1M tokens, 256K context) and pointed all six official Moonshot Kimi presets (Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop, Hermes, OpenCode, OpenClaw) at it, renaming the OpenCode / OpenClaw presets to "Kimi K2.7 Code". The pricing seed applies on startup via the idempotent insert path, so existing users pick up the new pricing without a migration.
- **Codex "Kimi For Coding" Preset Restored**: Re-added the Codex "Kimi For Coding" preset (`openai_chat`, `kimi-for-coding`, 256K context) with thinking mode enabled by default; it was previously removed because the coding endpoint rejects Codex's default `codex-cli` User-Agent with 403. It now works via proxy takeover combined with the custom User-Agent override (set to a whitelisted UA such as `claude-cli/*`).
- **Pricing-Model Audit in Request Detail**: The request detail panel now shows the requested model and the pricing model when they differ from the response model, making route-takeover bills auditable directly from the usage UI.
- **Preset Provider Search & Sorting**: The provider preset selector gains a searchable, sorted list with an inline search box (toggled via a magnifier icon, dismissed on ESC or outside click). Buttons use a responsive grid with consistent sizing and default icons, and search matches only provider display/raw names so URL fragments and shared category labels no longer produce noisy matches (#3975, #4183).
- **Claude Mythos 5 Pricing**: Registered the `claude-mythos-5` model in the bundled model/pricing table (in $10 / out $50 per 1M tokens, cache read $1.00, cache write $12.50), so usage metering prices and displays it correctly (#4077).
- **Fable 5 Verified Banner**: The Settings About page now displays a Fable 5 Verified banner beside the app name and version, marking this as a special build, with the version badge centered under the app name.

### Changed

- **Claude Desktop Usage Folded Into Claude**: The dashboard no longer shows a standalone "Claude Desktop" bucket, which only ever displayed a partial number (Desktop chat usage never passes through the proxy and its Code-tab sessions write into the shared `~/.claude/projects` tree). Desktop proxy traffic is now folded into the `claude` view for display while still recorded under its own `app_type` for route-takeover billing audit, with the real value visible in the request detail panel.
- **Lightweight Provider Health Check**: The provider health check no longer sends a real streaming model request (which many third-party providers blocked with 401/403/WAF, causing false negatives); it now performs a lightweight HTTP reachability probe of the provider `base_url`, treating any HTTP response as reachable and counting only DNS/connect/TLS/timeout as failure. The connectivity button is hidden for official providers (which use OAuth with an empty base URL and no reliable reachability target), the real-request confirmation dialog and test model/prompt fields are removed, and the degraded-latency threshold is set to 6s with an 8s timeout. The reachability check never resets the circuit breaker, so failover detection stays driven solely by real proxy traffic.
- **Codex Advanced Options Section**: The Codex provider form now folds local routing, model mapping, reasoning overrides, and custom User-Agent into a single collapsible advanced section mirroring the Claude form (auto-expanding when a UA is set or local routing is on). Custom User-Agent is now also configurable for native Responses providers, where it was previously reachable only with `openai_chat` routing enabled.
- **Usage Toolbar Refresh and Layout**: The app filter now renders brand icons (via ProviderIcon, with a grid icon for "All") instead of text tabs that wrapped awkwardly in narrow windows, and the usage hero shows the selected app's brand icon with Codex recolored to a neutral gray matching OpenAI's monochrome branding. The click-to-cycle refresh button becomes a Select with a localized "off" label, and the top-bar controls are compacted and aligned into consistent width groups with truncated long date-range labels.
- **Faster About Panel Loading**: The Settings About panel now loads progressively: the app version badge appears the instant it resolves instead of waiting for tool probes, each tool card updates the moment its own version check finishes (probes run concurrently rather than sequentially), and results are cached for the app session with a 10-minute TTL so reopening the About tab reuses cached values and revalidates stale ones in the background instead of re-probing all six tools every time.
- **Volcengine Ark Coding Plan Promo**: Updated the Volcengine Ark preset across all six apps with the new Coding Plan invite link (replacing the old Agent Plan / activity links) and refreshed the partner promotion copy in all four locales (two-month 75% off plus invite code 6J6FV5N2), correcting the product name from Agent Plan to Coding Plan.
- **MiniMax Demoted to Regular Provider**: Removed the gold partner star badge and the API-key promotion banner for MiniMax by dropping the `isPartner` flag from all its presets; it stays as a regular `cn_official` provider keeping its icon and theme. The promotion copy is kept dormant so the partnership can be re-enabled with a single line.
- **LemonData Removed, SudoCode Demoted**: Removed the LemonData provider preset entirely from all apps along with its promotion copy, icons, and sponsor listings, and demoted SudoCode from a partner to a regular `third_party` provider by dropping its `isPartner` flag and promotion copy (it keeps its icon).
- **AtlasCloud Codex GLM 5.1 Context Window**: Declared the 200,000-token context window for the `zai-org/glm-5.1` model in the AtlasCloud Codex preset, matching the other GLM 5.1 preset entries.

### Fixed

- **Route-Takeover Traffic Billed by the Real Upstream Model**: When a request was routed to a different upstream (env model mapping, Claude Desktop routes, Copilot normalization, Codex chat override), the proxy used to attribute and price usage by whatever model the upstream echoed back, recording kimi/glm tokens as `claude-*` and overstating cost roughly 5–25×. The forwarder now captures the real outbound model, attributes usage by upstream-echo then outbound then client alias, persists the actual pricing basis on every row (schema v11), and keeps that basis through cost backfill and 30-day rollup pruning; Claude Desktop traffic is now logged under its own `app_type` so its pricing overrides apply.
- **Usage Metering on Format-Conversion Proxy Paths**: Audited and fixed token/cache accounting across the proxy's format-conversion paths (Chat, Responses, and Gemini converted to Anthropic). The proxy now records the actually returned model, injects `stream_options.include_usage` so OpenAI-compatible upstreams emit usage in streaming, excludes `cache_read` and `cache_creation` from input on Claude←OpenAI paths to stop double-billing cache tokens, subtracts cached Gemini prompt tokens, still records fully-cached requests, and skips synthetic all-zero usage that previously inflated request counts (#2774).
- **In-App Update No Longer Hangs on Restart**: Installing an update from within the app no longer freezes on the "restarting" screen, leaving the new version installed but requiring a manual force-quit. The download-install-restart chain now runs entirely in the backend (a new `install_update_and_restart` command) with platform-aware install ordering and single-instance-lock teardown before re-exec, instead of depending on the old WebView to keep running JS after the app bundle was already swapped; exit requests are also classified so restart requests fall through to Tauri's default flow rather than deadlocking on the window-state plugin mutex (#4069, #4074).
- **Codex Upgrade No Longer Breaks the Install**: Upgrading Codex from the Settings "About" tab no longer leaves it throwing "Missing optional dependency @openai/codex-…" errors. The upgrade chain previously ran `codex update` first, which on an npm install is a bare reinstall that reports success even when the per-platform binary fails to land; Codex is now removed from the self-update-first path and a runnable check triggers an uninstall+reinstall self-heal (scoped to npm-managed installs) that actually re-lands the missing platform binary.
- **Codex OAuth Auth Token Preserved on Proxy Takeover**: Enabling proxy takeover for a Codex provider no longer strips the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` placeholder, which previously broke Claude Code's login on hot-switches, fresh installs, and configs already stripped by older releases. The placeholder is now injected unconditionally for managed (non-Copilot) Codex providers, including URL-only ones; GitHub Copilot behavior (API_KEY only) is unchanged (#3789, #3784).
- **Takeover-Residue Recovery Across Config-Dir Switches**: Restarting the app after changing the config directory while proxy takeover is active no longer leaves Claude/Codex/Gemini pointed at a dead local proxy. The old instance now restores the taken-over live files before restarting, the first-run import refuses to persist a takeover placeholder as a provider, and SSOT restore validates that the current provider's config is free of placeholders before writing it back (#4076).
- **Mislabeled SSE Bodies in Format-Transform Fallback**: Requests routed through Claude/Codex format conversion no longer fail with an opaque 422 "Failed to parse upstream response" when a MaaS gateway force-streams a `stream:false` request and returns an SSE body under a non-SSE Content-Type. The proxy now sniffs for SSE on parse failure, aggregates the chunks into a single JSON, and runs the existing converter so clients still get a valid non-stream response; remaining parse failures are enriched with content-type, encoding, and body-snippet diagnostics, and deflate decoding now tries zlib before raw (#2234).
- **Duplicate YAML Keys in Hermes Config**: Hermes config writes no longer accumulate duplicate top-level keys (e.g. `mcp_servers`) that caused "Failed to parse Hermes config as YAML: duplicate entry with key" errors. Section replacement now strips all stale occurrences from the remainder instead of degrading into appends, the dedup safety net handles both LF and CRLF line endings, and healing keeps the last (newest) occurrence to match Hermes's own last-wins PyYAML semantics (#3267, #3633, #2973, #2529, #3310, #3762).
- **Usage Query Resilience and Error Clarity**: Usage cards no longer flip to red on a single transient blip: queries now retry once and keep showing the last successful result for up to 10 minutes on network/timeout/5xx failures, while deterministic failures (auth, empty key, unknown provider, 4xx) surface immediately and clear the snapshot so a stale quota can't resurface after credentials change. Native balance/coding-plan/subscription timeouts were raised from 10s to 15s for slow cross-border endpoints, and coding-plan now returns explicit "API key is empty" / "Unknown coding plan provider" errors instead of a blank failure.
- **Usage Script Provider Credential Resolution**: Custom JS-script usage queries resolved `{{apiKey}}` / `{{baseUrl}}` by guessing env fields only, so providers that store credentials elsewhere (e.g. Codex's `auth.OPENAI_API_KEY` plus `config.toml` base_url) always got empty values and failed despite being fully configured. Script queries and the test/preview now reuse the same per-app credential resolver as the native balance path, with explicit non-empty script values still taking precedence (#1479).
- **Claude Code Workflow Sub-Agent Usage Counted**: Local (no-proxy) session-log usage accounting missed Claude Code Workflow sub-agent traffic, under-counting overall usage by roughly 4.1% (concentrated in workflow/subagent transcripts). The scanner now descends into the deeper `subagents/workflows/wf_*/` transcript directories, and the parser no longer drops billable assistant messages that lack a `stop_reason` but already incurred input/cache token cost; dedup is unchanged so no usage is double-counted.
- **Codex Image Rectifier for /responses Text-Only Upstreams**: Codex `/responses` requests carrying images and routed to text-only OpenAI-chat models (e.g. DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-flash`) no longer fail with HTTP 400 "unknown variant `image_url`". The media rectifier now also covers the Codex adapter, scanning the responses `input` for `input_image` blocks so it can proactively strip images for known text-only models and reactively retry with images replaced on upstream image-unsupported errors.
- **Zhipu Coding-Plan Quota Window Mislabeling**: The Zhipu coding-plan view no longer swaps the 5-hour and weekly quota buckets in the final hours of each weekly cycle. The two windows are now classified by the explicit `unit` field (3 = 5-hour, 6 = weekly) instead of by sorting reset-time ascending, which mislabeled them exactly when users check their weekly quota most; the old reset-time heuristic remains as a fallback (#3036).
- **Duplicate Provider Terminal Sessions on macOS**: Launching a provider terminal on macOS no longer opens an extra empty window alongside the command session; Terminal.app uses `launch` (not `activate`) on cold start and Ghostty uses an initial-command so a single session opens, with a fallback retained if the AppleScript path fails (#4156).
- **Claude Desktop Model-Mapping Placeholders**: The Claude Desktop model-mapping form previously showed mismatched example brands across the menu display name and request model columns (DeepSeek vs Kimi), implying a display name maps to an unrelated model. Both placeholders are now derived from each row's role so they stay brand-consistent, with the lightweight Haiku tier using a flash example.
- **Popovers Behind Fullscreen Panels**: Popovers and tooltips such as the provider preset search no longer render behind fullscreen panels and appear unresponsive on click; their z-index is raised above the fullscreen overlay while staying below modal dialogs.
- **ToggleRow Icon Shrinking**: Toggle row icons no longer shrink or distort when paired with long descriptions, keeping the icon at a fixed size next to multi-line text.

### Docs

- **Release Notes Contributor Mentions**: Restored contributor mentions in the v3.16.1 and v3.16.2 release notes across all three locales.

## [3.16.2] - 2026-06-07

Development since v3.16.1 focuses on broadening data portability and usage observability — S3-compatible cloud sync, OpenCode session usage import, and an opt-in official-subscription quota template — while hardening Codex Chat Completions routing (stream truncation, `tool_choice` / custom-tool / reasoning-token edge cases, file and audio attachments, and a Codex CLI models endpoint), strengthening proxy robustness (ephemeral ports, takeover/placeholder restore, system-message normalization, clearer upstream errors, and a text-only image fallback), fixing coding-plan quota lookups (Zhipu, MiniMax) and several Windows/macOS issues, adding the CherryIN and ZenMux providers, and refreshing the user manual.

**Stats**: 41 commits | 132 files changed | +11,116 insertions | -1,636 deletions

### Added

- **S3-Compatible Cloud Sync**: Cloud Sync now supports S3-compatible object storage as a second backend alongside WebDAV, using hand-rolled AWS Signature V4 signing for broad compatibility. The settings panel offers one-click presets for AWS S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, and Huawei OBS plus a custom endpoint, with connection testing, manual upload/download, and auto-sync on configuration changes (provider, endpoint, MCP, prompt, skill, settings, and proxy tables — not high-frequency data like usage logs); enabling S3 sync disables active WebDAV sync and vice versa (#1351).
- **OpenCode Session Usage Sync**: Added OpenCode as a usage-statistics source that imports per-message token, cost, and model data from OpenCode's local SQLite database, with a new "OpenCode" app filter tab and an "OpenCode Session" data-source label. The database path respects `OPENCODE_DB` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` (defaulting to `~/.local/share/opencode` on all platforms), only finalized messages are imported, and the freshness check accounts for the WAL file so newly written sessions are not skipped (#3215).
- **Official Subscription Quota Template**: Added an explicit, opt-in "official subscription" usage template for Claude, Codex, and Gemini official providers that queries plan quota via CLI/OAuth credentials, replacing the previous implicit auto-query. It is disabled by default and enabled from the usage-script modal with a configurable refresh interval.
- **Unsupported Image Fallback Rectifier**: Added a proxy rectifier that replaces Anthropic image blocks with an `[Unsupported Image]` marker when the routed model is text-only (declared, or detected via a built-in model-name heuristic) or when the upstream rejects image input, so conversations are not interrupted. A new Settings toggle controls the fallback, with a separate toggle for the heuristic detection.
- **ZenMux Token Plan Provider**: Added ZenMux as a Token Plan coding-plan provider that accepts a manually entered API key and base URL in the usage-script modal and renders its quota with USD-denominated used / limit values (#2709).
- **CherryIN Preset**: Added the CherryIN aggregator gateway as a quick-config preset across all seven supported apps — Anthropic-format endpoint for Claude Code / Claude Desktop / OpenClaw / Hermes, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` for OpenCode, the OpenAI-compatible endpoint for Codex, and the Gemini-compatible endpoint for Gemini CLI — with the official brand icon, placed next to AiHubMix (#3643).
- **CCSub Preset**: Added CCSub, a multi-model aggregator partner, as a quick-config preset across six apps — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes — with the official brand icon and the partner referral link prefilled as the API-key signup URL (`gpt-5.5` for the OpenAI-compatible Codex and OpenCode endpoints).
- **Codex CLI Models Endpoint**: The local proxy now answers `GET /v1/models`, which Codex CLI probes at startup, returning the cc-switch-managed Codex model catalog. A stale-catalog guard parses the live `config.toml` and only serves the catalog when `model_catalog_json` still references the cc-switch-owned file, so a leftover catalog from a previous provider is not advertised (#3818).
- **Codex Chat File and Audio Attachments**: The Codex Responses-to-Chat converter now maps `input_file` parts (carrying `file_id` or inline `file_data`) and `input_audio` parts into their Chat Completions equivalents, and emits top-level `input_*` items that were previously dropped, so file and audio attachments reach Chat-only Codex upstreams.

### Changed

- **Usage Dashboard Hero Redesign**: Restructured the Usage Dashboard hero and summary cards into a more compact layout, consolidating the real-token total, request count, and cost into a single top row (#3426).
- **SSSAiCode Endpoint Refresh**: Updated the SSSAiCode preset's website, signup, and API base URLs to the `sssaicodeapi.com` domain and refreshed its endpoint nodes (default `node-hk.sssaicodeapi.com`, plus `node-hk.sssaiapi.com` and `node-cf.sssaicodeapi.com`) across all seven app presets.

### Fixed

- **Codex Chat Truncated Stream Detection**: When a Chat Completions upstream ends a stream without a `finish_reason` or `[DONE]`, CC Switch no longer reports it as a normal completion — it finalizes normally only when the stream truly finished, emits an incomplete (`max_output_tokens`) response when partial output was produced, and emits a failed `stream_truncated` event when nothing was produced. Late-arriving reasoning is also attached to still-active streamed tool calls.
- **Codex Chat `tool_choice` Without Tools**: The Responses-to-Chat converter now drops `tool_choice` and `parallel_tool_calls` whenever the resulting tools array is absent or empty, so strict OpenAI-compatible upstreams (vLLM, enterprise gateways) no longer reject the request with "When using `tool_choice`, `tools` must be set." (#3640).
- **Codex Custom Tool Metadata Over Chat Routing**: Custom Codex tools (such as the freeform `apply_patch` tool) now preserve their full original definition — including format and grammar metadata — as a compact, order-stable JSON block in the generated Chat function description instead of a generic placeholder, keeping them usable on Chat Completions upstreams (#3644).
- **Codex Chat `reasoning_tokens` in Usage**: The Chat-to-Responses usage conversion now always includes `output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` (defaulting to 0), even when a provider omits `completion_tokens_details` or returns it as a non-object, satisfying the Codex CLI's strict requirement and avoiding repeated parse failures and retries (#3514).
- **Codex Cross-Turn Reasoning for Custom and Search Tools**: The cross-turn reasoning cache in Codex Chat history now covers the full tool-call set (`function_call`, `custom_tool_call`, `tool_search_call`) and their outputs, so `apply_patch` and tool-search calls keep their `reasoning_content` when restored via `previous_response_id`.
- **Ephemeral Proxy Port Resolution**: When the proxy listens on port 0 (OS-assigned), takeover now starts the proxy first to learn the real port and writes it into the Live configs and database, so client URLs no longer point at a broken `:0` address; the Claude Desktop gateway URL is rejected if no concrete port has been resolved.
- **Proxy Placeholder Backup/Restore Loop**: If a previous proxy stop left the proxy placeholders in Live, taking over again no longer overwrites a good backup with the proxy config, and restore no longer writes the placeholder back to Live — both paths detect the placeholder state and rebuild Live from the current provider, fixing cases where the proxy toggle became a no-op and clients stayed pinned to the local proxy (#3689).
- **Official Provider Block Under Proxy Takeover**: While Local Routing takeover is active, only providers explicitly categorized as official are blocked from switching, instead of also disabling custom providers whose endpoint lives in metadata or whose fields are unfilled. The disabled Enable button now shows a lighter hint tooltip in place of the red "Blocked" badge.
- **Localhost Listen Address Normalization**: Saving the proxy with a listen address of `localhost` now normalizes it to `127.0.0.1` before persisting, avoiding binding inconsistencies (#3016).
- **Anthropic System Message Normalization**: For Anthropic-format providers, system-role entries inside the `messages` array are collapsed and merged into the top-level `system` field (preserving order and any existing top-level system), preventing strict upstreams from rejecting non-leading system messages; OpenAI Chat routing is untouched (#3775).
- **Claude Desktop 1M-Context Model Routing**: Claude Desktop appends a `[1m]` marker to the model name when the 1M-context beta is active (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]`). The proxy now strips that suffix before route lookup so exact, alias, legacy, and role-keyword matching resolve correctly, fixing `route_unknown` (HTTP 400) failures when switching to a 1M-capable model mid-conversation.
- **Codex 413 Error Clarity**: When a Codex upstream gateway rejects an oversized request with HTTP 413, the proxy now returns a dedicated message identifying it as the provider's server-side body-size limit (not a CC Switch limit) with recovery steps (run `/compact`, drop large logs or inline images, or ask the provider to raise its limit), instead of echoing the raw upstream HTML page.
- **Proxy Panel Error Detail**: When toggling proxy takeover fails, the proxy panel toast now includes the underlying backend error detail instead of only a generic failure message (#3656).
- **Copilot Infinite-Whitespace Threshold**: Raised the streaming infinite-whitespace abort threshold from 20 to 500 consecutive whitespace characters, so legitimate tool calls with deeply indented code arguments are no longer falsely aborted while still catching the real Copilot infinite-whitespace bug (#2647).
- **Subscription Tier Tray Rendering**: Fixed tray and quota rendering for official subscription tiers via a unified tier-to-label mapping: Claude/Codex no longer drop the seven-day window, Gemini Pro/Flash/Flash-Lite tiers no longer leak raw machine names, and multi-window plans (e.g. Opus + Sonnet) now display the worst utilization instead of the first match.
- **Inflated Claude Stream Input Tokens**: Some Anthropic-compatible streaming providers (e.g. Qwen, MiniMax) report the full context as `input_tokens` in `message_start`, double-counting the cached portion and artificially lowering the displayed cache hit rate. The parser now prefers a smaller positive `input_tokens` from `message_delta` and adopts the paired cache counts from the same usage block; native Claude and OpenRouter-converted paths are unchanged.
- **Zhipu Quota Query Endpoint Routing**: The Zhipu coding-plan quota lookup was hard-coded to `api.z.ai`, so users on the mainland China preset (`open.bigmodel.cn`) could not retrieve usage when the international endpoint was unreachable. The quota request now routes to the host matching the user's configured base URL (#3702).
- **MiniMax Balance API and Pricing**: Adapted MiniMax coding-plan quota to its new balance API (which returns remaining-percent fields instead of usage counts that broke the old parser and left the tray blank), filtered out non-coding models (e.g. video), handled plans without a weekly limit, and seeded default pricing for MiniMax M3 (#3518).
- **GLM Coding Plan Endpoints and Model Fetch**: Corrected the ZhiPu / Z.AI GLM Coding Plan presets to the `/api/coding/paas/v4` endpoints across Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, and taught the model-list probe to query `{base}/models` for base URLs that already end in a `/v{N}` segment (keeping `/v1/models` as a fallback), so the Fetch Models button no longer 404s on versioned endpoints (#3524).
- **Codex Model Catalog Path Portability**: Codex now writes only the relative filename `cc-switch-model-catalog.json` to `config.toml` instead of an absolute path (Codex CLI resolves it from the config directory), fixing the model catalog breaking on WSL and symlinked setups where the absolute path could not be translated (#3614).
- **APINebula OpenCode SDK**: The APINebula OpenCode preset now loads `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` instead of `@ai-sdk/openai`, so requests use the OpenAI Chat Completions format the relay expects rather than the Responses API.
- **Windows Tray Icon Residue on Exit**: Quitting CC Switch on Windows could leave a dead tray icon until hovered; the app now removes the tray icon before exiting so it disappears cleanly (#3797).
- **Windows Taskbar Icon**: Set an explicit Windows AppUserModelID at runtime and stamped the installer's desktop and start-menu shortcuts with the same ID and product icon, so CC Switch shows the correct icon and groups properly in the taskbar (#3457).
- **Windows Subdirectory Skill Updates**: Normalized backslash path separators to forward slashes when scanning installed skills on Windows, so skills nested in subdirectories (e.g. `skills/my-skill`) are matched by the update check instead of being silently skipped (#3430).
- **macOS Input Auto-Capitalization**: Disabled autocomplete, autocorrect, autocapitalize, and spellcheck on the shared text Input component so macOS no longer auto-capitalizes or auto-corrects the first letter typed into configuration fields (#3626).
- **Codex VS Code Session Previews**: Codex session previews for requests sent from VS Code could show selection or open-file content instead of the prompt when a markdown heading preceded the injected request. Both the backend title and frontend preview now match the last "## My request for Codex:" heading (the IDE injects the real request as the final section) (#3593).
- **VS Code Wording in Chinese UI**: Corrected the "Apply to Claude Code plugin" description in the Simplified and Traditional Chinese locales to write "VS Code" properly instead of "Vscode", aligning with the English and Japanese strings (#3228).

### Docs

- **User Manual Refresh**: Refreshed the README locales and the en / zh / ja user manuals to reflect all seven supported apps (adding Claude Desktop and Hermes), corrected the OpenCode config path to `~/.config/opencode/` (`opencode.json`), documented Hermes configuration files, updated the language docs to four languages, revised per-app MCP / Prompts / Skills availability, noted that export produces a timestamped SQL backup including usage logs, and documented the pricing model-ID matching rules (#3411).
- **Codex Official Auth Preservation Guide**: Added a trilingual (en / zh / ja) guide explaining how to keep Codex official remote control and plugins working while routing model traffic to third-party APIs, and linked it from the v3.16.1 release notes.
- **README Release-Note Links and Sponsor Markup**: Updated the Release Notes links in all README locales to point at v3.16.1 and fixed broken smart-quote characters in the README_ZH sponsor blocks so their HTML attributes render correctly (#3772).

## [3.16.1] - 2026-06-01

Development since v3.16.0 focuses on hardening Codex provider switching and Local Routing takeover: preserving official OAuth auth and model catalogs across normal switches, hot-switches, backup restore, and edit flows; restoring Codex Chat tool/plugin compatibility over Chat Completions upstreams; improving Codex proxy diagnostics and CLI discovery; and documenting DeepSeek routing.

**Stats**: 23 commits | 62 files changed | +5,603 insertions | -1,113 deletions

### Added

- **Codex Official Auth Preservation Setting**: Added an opt-in setting that keeps the official ChatGPT / Codex OAuth login in `auth.json` when switching third-party Codex providers, while moving third-party provider tokens into `config.toml` when enabled.
- **Codex DeepSeek Routing Guides**: Added localized DeepSeek routing guides for Codex in English, Chinese, and Japanese, with screenshots covering provider routing requirements, Codex provider setup, and Local Routing takeover.

### Changed

- **Codex Auth Preservation Is Opt-In**: The new official-auth preservation setting now defaults to off, so third-party Codex switches keep the legacy behavior of writing the active provider auth unless users explicitly enable preservation.
- **Codex Provider Switch Restart Hint**: Successful Codex provider switches now tell users to restart the Codex client so catalog and config changes take effect.
- **Codex Proxy Takeover Switching Is Serialized**: Provider switches and takeover toggles now share a per-app lock and use backup / live placeholder ownership signals instead of lagging `enabled` or server-running flags, preventing normal live writes from racing a just-activated or temporarily stopped takeover.
- **Codex Takeover Hot-Switch Display Refresh**: Hot-switching a Codex provider while Local Routing owns Live now refreshes the proxy-safe live provider id, model, and display name while keeping endpoints pointed at the local proxy.
- **Sponsor Ordering**: Swapped the Shengsuanyun and AICodeMirror sponsor blocks across README locales.
- **Docs Organization**: Moved the Chinese proxy guide under `docs/guides/` and removed the obsolete working-directory plan document.

### Fixed

- **Codex Provider Edit Dialog Under Takeover**: The Codex provider edit form now shows an explicit notice and storage-aware auth / config hints clarifying that it displays the stored provider config (not the proxy-managed live `auth.json` / `config.toml`), so the official OAuth token is no longer mistaken as lost while takeover is active. The dialog also treats takeover as active regardless of whether the proxy server is currently running.
- **Codex OAuth Auth During Proxy Takeover**: Fixed multiple preserve-mode takeover paths that could clear or overwrite the official ChatGPT / Codex OAuth `auth.json`. Takeover detection now recognizes `PROXY_MANAGED` in `config.toml`, cleanup only removes placeholder bearer tokens, config-only takeover writes are used consistently, and mis-categorized third-party providers no longer trigger the official-provider auth overwrite path. Provider sync and switching now treat the restore backup and live placeholders as the takeover-ownership signal (instead of the lagging `enabled` / proxy-running flags) and serialize switch/takeover per app, so a just-activated or proxy-stopped takeover can no longer be overwritten by a normal live write.
- **Codex Model Catalog Data Loss**: Fixed cases where Codex `modelCatalog` could be wiped by live-config backfill, active-provider edit dialogs, provider switches, or proxy takeover-off restore. Snapshot backups now keep existing `model_catalog_json` pointers, provider-rebuilt backups regenerate the catalog projection from the database source of truth, active edit dialogs prefer the DB catalog over lossy Live reconstruction, and provider switches always refresh the generated catalog JSON.
- **Codex Chat Tools Over Chat Completions Routing**: Restored Codex `tool_search`, loaded namespace tools, custom tools, and tool outputs when third-party Codex providers are routed through Chat Completions. Non-streaming and streaming Chat responses now map back to the right Responses item types, including native `response.custom_tool_call_input.*` events for custom-tool streaming.
- **Codex Proxy Error Diagnostics**: Codex forwarding failures now return richer JSON errors with provider, model, endpoint, upstream status, stable `cc_switch_*` codes, and HTTP statuses aligned with the canonical `ProxyError` response mapping.
- **Codex Native Balance / Coding-Plan Queries**: Fixed native usage and plan lookups so each app resolves the correct provider credentials instead of leaking assumptions from another app surface.
- **Codex CLI Discovery and Catalog Projection**: Fixed third-party Codex catalog projection that could fail when the Codex CLI was not reachable through one narrow PATH lookup, by adding multi-platform CLI discovery plus a bundled GPT-5.5 model-catalog template fallback.
- **Claude Desktop Official Provider Creation**: Fixed adding the Claude Desktop Official provider when the official category/config path was selected.
- **Anthropic Tool Thinking History for Kimi / Moonshot**: Added Kimi and Moonshot to the Anthropic-compatible tool-thinking history normalizer so later turns can replay reasoning and tool-call context correctly.
- **Windows Tool Version Probing**: Fixed Windows version checks that could misquote `.cmd` / `.bat` commands and decode localized command output as mojibake, causing working tools to appear as "installed but not runnable".

## [3.16.0] - 2026-05-29

Development since v3.15.0 focuses on making third-party Codex providers work like first-class citizens through Chat Completions routing, stabilizing Codex provider identity and history, adding an in-app managed CLI tool lifecycle, expanding the partner preset catalog, refreshing the default model / pricing matrix around GPT-5.5 and Claude Opus 4.8, and improving usage observability, localization, docs, and proxy robustness.

**Stats**: 101 commits | 221 files changed | +27,063 insertions | -3,052 deletions

### Highlights

- **Codex Chat Completions routing**: Codex providers can now be served by OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions upstreams. CC Switch converts Codex Responses requests into Chat Completions, rebuilds JSON and SSE responses back into Responses shape, preserves reasoning / `<think>` / tool-call state, normalizes error envelopes, and probes Chat-format providers correctly in Stream Check.
- **Codex third-party provider state is unified and safer**: third-party Codex providers now share the stable `custom` model-provider bucket, with a one-shot migration for historical JSONL sessions and `state_5.sqlite` threads, plus fixes that preserve OAuth login state, user-selected catalog models, and user-authored provider ids during live reads / switches.
- **Managed CLI tool management**: the About page is now a tool management panel for Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, with install / update actions, update-all, conflict diagnostics, source-aware anchored upgrades, WSL handling, and visible "installed but not runnable" states.
- **Provider ecosystem and model matrix refresh**: added APIKEY.FUN, APINebula, AtlasCloud, SudoCode, Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan, and Claude Desktop Official presets; refreshed partner links and default models / pricing across apps; upgraded the default Claude Opus model line to 4.8 and GPT defaults to 5.5 where applicable.
- **Usage and docs polish**: Usage Dashboard updates now react immediately when logs are written, custom usage-script summaries and subagent session-log accounting were fixed, Traditional Chinese UI localization landed, and a German README plus expanded Claude Desktop / Codex Chat / tool-management manuals were added.
- **Proxy and conversion hardening**: fixed Codex Chat reasoning / cache / usage edge cases, DeepSeek Anthropic tool-thinking history, Claude-compatible empty `tool_calls` streams, managed-account takeover auth, MiMo reasoning output, Gemini Native tool-call replay, and several panic-prone proxy paths.

### Added

- **Codex Chat Completions Routing**: Codex providers can now be served by upstreams that only speak the OpenAI Chat Completions API. CC Switch's local proxy converts Codex's outgoing Responses requests into Chat Completions and rebuilds the Chat response (both JSON and SSE) back into Responses shape, preserving `reasoning_content`, inline `<think>` blocks, streamed reasoning summaries, tool calls, and `previous_response_id` follow-ups. A bounded Codex Chat history cache restores tool calls before their tool outputs.
- **22 Codex Third-Party Provider Presets with Chat Routing**: Enabled Chat Completions routing with explicit model catalogs for major Chinese/Asian providers — DeepSeek, Zhipu GLM (+ en), Kimi, MiniMax (+ en), StepFun (+ en), Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan, Bailian, ModelScope, Longcat, BaiLing, Xiaomi MiMo (+ Token Plan), Volcengine Agentplan, BytePlus, DouBao Seed, SiliconFlow (+ en), Novita AI, and Nvidia. Each preset declares its context window so the UI can size the model-mapping rows.
- **Codex Model Mapping Table**: Codex provider forms now expose a model catalog (model + display name + context window per row) that is the single source of truth for the upstream model list, projected to `~/.codex/cc-switch-model-catalog.json`.
- **Codex Chat Providers in Stream Check**: Stream Check now probes Chat-format Codex providers against `/chat/completions` with a Chat-shaped body instead of `/v1/responses`, and aligns its URL fallback order with the production `CodexAdapter` (origin-only base URLs hit `/v1/<endpoint>` first) so a non-404 error on the bare path no longer flags a working provider as down.
- **Codex Chat Reasoning Auto-Detection**: When a Codex provider is served through Chat Completions routing, CC Switch now auto-detects the upstream's reasoning interface from its name, base URL, and model — injecting the correct thinking parameter (`thinking:{type}`, `enable_thinking`, `reasoning_split`, top-level `reasoning_effort`, or OpenRouter's native `reasoning:{effort}` object) with no manual setup. Aggregator/hosting platforms (OpenRouter, SiliconFlow) are matched platform-first, since the same model can expose different reasoning controls on different platforms. Providers that only expose a thinking on/off switch (Kimi, GLM, Qwen, MiniMax, MiMo, SiliconFlow) drop the effort *level* instead of forwarding an unsupported field — so changing Codex's reasoning effort has no effect for them — while providers with real effort tiers (DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and StepFun's `step-3.5-flash-2603` only) pass the level through. OpenRouter specifically uses the native `reasoning:{effort}` object, clamps `max` to `xhigh` (its enum has no `max`), and forwards an explicit `effort:"none"` so reasoning can be turned off.
- **Codex Goal Mode and Remote Compaction Controls**: Codex config editing now exposes a Goal Mode toggle and a Remote Compaction toggle for third-party providers; new Codex templates default to `disable_response_storage = true` while still allowing explicit goal support.
- **Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan Presets**: Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan presets with specs aligned to the official documentation (#2803).
- **Claude Desktop Official Preset**: Added a Claude Desktop Official preset that restores the native Claude Desktop login, plus a localized Claude Desktop user guide (en / zh / ja).
- **Managed CLI Tool Lifecycle**: Added silent install / update commands for managed CLI tools, latest-version checks, per-tool and batch actions, update-all, and diagnostics for multiple installations across PATH, Homebrew, npm, pnpm, bun, volta, fnm, nvm, scoop, WinGet, Windows native paths, and WSL.
- **Source-Aware Tool Diagnostics**: The Settings / About surface can now diagnose conflicting tool installations, show the concrete install source and version for each path, and generate backend-planned upgrade commands anchored to the actual installation source.
- **Real-Time Usage Refresh**: The backend now emits `usage-log-recorded` when proxy logs, session-log syncs, or rollups write usage data; Usage Dashboard listens for that event and invalidates its queries immediately instead of waiting for the next polling interval (#3027).
- **Traditional Chinese Localization**: Added `zh-TW` UI localization and a settings language option (#3093).
- **German README**: Added `README_DE.md` and linked it from the existing README language switchers (#2994).
- **New Partner Presets**: Added APIKEY.FUN, APINebula, AtlasCloud, and SudoCode partner presets across the supported app surfaces, with partner copy, icons, and README entries.

### Changed

- **Codex Third-Party Providers Unified into a "custom" History Bucket**: Codex filters resume history by `model_provider`, so switching between provider-specific ids made past sessions appear to vanish. All third-party providers now normalize to a single stable `custom` bucket (reserved built-in ids like `openai` / `ollama` are preserved), with a one-shot device migration that rewrites historical JSONL sessions and the `state_5.sqlite` threads table and backs up originals under `~/.cc-switch/backups/codex-history-provider-migration-v1/`.
- **Codex Provider Form Simplified**: Removed the API Format selector from the Codex form (`wire_api` is always `responses`, so the selector misleadingly implied a protocol change); the model mapping table is now the only source of truth with no hidden default entries, and the form notes that a Codex restart is required after catalog changes since `model_catalog_json` is loaded at startup. Only the "Needs Local Routing" toggle remains.
- **Codex Local Routing Toggle Hints Rewritten**: Reframed the OFF / ON hints as action guidance (when to enable) rather than scenario descriptions, synced across zh / en / ja.
- **Codex Live Config Preservation**: Live Codex config reads no longer force-rewrite a user's `model_provider` field, and provider-scoped `experimental_bearer_token` handling now preserves OAuth login state when switching between third-party providers.
- **Tool Install / Upgrade Strategy**: Managed tool installation now prefers official native installers where available, falls back to package managers when appropriate, runs self-update first for compatible tools, anchors upgrades to the detected install source, and locks duplicate batch actions while work is in flight.
- **About Page Becomes Tool Management**: The About settings page now presents installed / latest versions, install and update actions, conflict diagnostics, WSL shell preferences, and clearer status for broken or unrunnable tools.
- **Default Models and Pricing Refreshed**: Upgraded the default Claude Opus model to 4.8, moved GPT-based presets and templates to GPT-5.5 where applicable, refreshed pricing seeds, aligned Claude Desktop model mapping with Claude Code's three-role tiers, and renamed the OpenCode Go preset to drop a stale model suffix.
- **Partner Links Refreshed**: Updated ShengSuanYun referral links, Atlas Cloud UTM links, and partner copy across README locales and provider metadata.
- **Homebrew Official Cask Installation**: Installation simplified to `brew install --cask cc-switch` now that CC Switch is in the official Homebrew repository; the personal-tap requirement was removed from all READMEs.
- **Shared Frontend Utilities**: Replaced JSON stringify / parse deep-copy patterns with a shared `deepClone` helper and extracted a shared `useTauriEvent` hook (#3140).

### Fixed

- **Codex Chat Error Responses Converted to Responses Envelope**: The Codex Chat-to-Responses bridge previously passed upstream error bodies through untouched, leaving Codex clients unable to recognize MiniMax `base_resp`, raw OpenAI Chat errors, or plain-text / HTML error pages. Errors are now regularized into the standard `{error: {message, type, code, param}}` envelope with the original HTTP status preserved; non-JSON bodies are wrapped and truncated to 1KB at a UTF-8 char boundary. Also fixed a pre-existing append-vs-insert bug that emitted a duplicate `Content-Type` header on rewritten JSON bodies.
- **Codex Mid-Stream System Messages Collapsed**: MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible endpoint strict-rejects any non-leading `system` message (error 2013). All `system` fragments are now collapsed into a single leading message (joined in original order), losslessly for permissive backends too.
- **Codex Model Catalog Wiped After Restart**: Editing the active Codex provider triggered a live read that omitted `modelCatalog`, so a subsequent save silently destroyed user-configured model mappings. Live reads now reverse-parse the on-disk catalog projection to round-trip the same shape the save path writes.
- **Codex Model Catalog Infinite Render Loop**: Broke a bidirectional sync cycle between the catalog table and its parent state that caused severe UI jittering when adding or editing entries.
- **Codex Chat Preserves User-Selected Catalog Model**: A model the client selects from the catalog (e.g. via `/model`) is no longer overwritten by `config.toml`'s default model.
- **Codex Chat Reasoning and Cache Stability**: Restored a unique call-id fallback when Codex omits or rewrites `previous_response_id`, stopped deriving cache identity from `previous_response_id`, and canonicalized parseable JSON string payloads in tool conversions for stable prefix-cache reuse.
- **Codex Chat Streaming Usage Recovered**: The Responses-to-Chat conversion now injects `stream_options.include_usage` (merging into any client-provided `stream_options`) when a request is streaming, so OpenAI-compatible upstreams like Kimi and MiniMax emit the trailing usage chunk again. Previously their streamed token / cost / cache stats were recorded as zero on the Codex Chat path.
- **Codex Chat Tool-Call Reasoning Backfill**: Thinking models like Kimi/Moonshot and DeepSeek reject an assistant message that carries `tool_calls` without a non-empty `reasoning_content`. When cross-turn history recovery misses (proxy restart, ambiguous `call_id`, or a turn with no upstream reasoning), a placeholder `reasoning_content` is now backfilled in a final pass — genuine trailing reasoning still attaches first — so the request no longer fails with `reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message`.
- **Managed-Account Claude Takeover Auth**: Managed-account providers (GitHub Copilot / Codex OAuth) now drop token env keys and write only the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` placeholder when taking over Claude Live config, with an outbound guard that refuses to send the `PROXY_MANAGED` placeholder upstream.
- **Claude Desktop Profile Sync During Takeover**: Claude Desktop profile data is now synced during proxy takeover, model routes align with the Claude Code three-role tiers, and the Cowork egress profile has been corrected (#3157, #3172).
- **Managed-Account Takeover Model Fields**: Local Routing now sources takeover model fields from the target provider on managed accounts instead of carrying stale model values.
- **DeepSeek Anthropic Tool Thinking History**: Normalized DeepSeek Anthropic-compatible tool-thinking history so later turns can replay reasoning / tool-call context without malformed messages (#3203).
- **Claude-Compatible Empty Tool Calls in Streams**: Fixed a Claude-compatible streaming edge case where an empty `tool_calls` array reset block state and broke streamed responses (#2915).
- **MiMo Reasoning for Claude Code Proxy**: Added MiMo `reasoning_content` support on the Claude Code proxy path (#2990).
- **Gemini Native Tool-Call Robustness**: Fixed `functionResponse.name` resolution (422) and `thought_signature` replay (400) for synthesized tool-call IDs in long multi-turn sessions (#2814).
- **Session Log Subagent Token Accounting**: `collect_jsonl_files()` now scans subagent JSONL logs that were previously missed, so subagent token usage is counted in session cost (session-log mode only) (#2821).
- **Usage Dashboard / Sync Stability**: Fixed a Codex usage-sync panic on non-ASCII model names, custom usage-script summaries, and missing real-time refresh after usage rollups (#3027, #3129).
- **ZhiPu Coding-Plan Quota Tier Ordering**: When the 5-hour bucket is at 0% utilization, ZhiPu's API omits `nextResetTime`; the old `i64::MAX` sentinel sorted those entries last, letting the weekly bucket incorrectly claim the five-hour slot. Tiers now sort so a missing `nextResetTime` maps to the five-hour bucket, so tray and usage quota display stays correct for ZhiPu coding plans.
- **Skills Install by Key**: Installing from skills.sh search results now uses the unique key instead of the directory name, so skills that share a directory name install the correct one (#2784); also fixed a skill sync copy fallback (#2791).
- **Usage Price Input Precision**: Reduced the price input step to 0.0001 so sub-cent costs like DeepSeek cache reads can be entered (#2793, closes #2503).
- **Ghostty Clean Window Launch**: Ghostty now opens a single clean window instead of cloning existing tabs, and other terminals open a new window via `open -na` (#2801, closes #2798).
- **Tool Version and Update Reliability**: Version probing no longer masks unrunnable installs, prerelease tools are handled correctly in version checks, batch updates run per tool, install / update buttons stay locked during preflight, anchored upgrade branches enforce absolute paths, and WSL installer paths use native Unix installers when needed.
- **Codex mise Detection**: Fixed Codex mise environment detection (#2822).
- **Codex Archived Sessions**: Codex archived sessions are now included in session discovery (#2861).
- **Codex Chat Empty Tool Arguments**: Empty tool-call argument payloads are coerced to `{}` during Codex Chat conversion so upstreams and clients receive valid JSON.
- **Claude Provider Deeplink Imports**: Importing Claude providers through deeplinks now preserves custom environment fields (#2928).
- **OMO Recommended Models**: Synced OMO recommended models with upstream defaults and improved Fill Recommended feedback.
- **ShengSuanYun Model IDs Prefixed for Routing**: ShengSuanYun (胜算云) presets now carry the vendor prefixes the upstream gateway requires — `anthropic/…`, `google/…`, and `openai/…` (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) — across the Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw presets, including the Claude Code routing env (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{HAIKU,SONNET,OPUS}_MODEL`), so they resolve to valid upstream models instead of failing to route.
- **ClaudeAPI Model Test Re-Enabled**: Reclassified the ClaudeAPI preset (Claude Code and Claude Desktop) from `third_party` to `aggregator` so its model test button is no longer disabled by the third-party Claude gate; the partner star is unaffected since it is driven by `isPartner`, not category.
- **About Version Check**: Version checks now handle prerelease tool versions without misclassifying update state.
- **App Switcher Text Clipping**: Removed a fixed width constraint that clipped app-switcher text (#3161).
- **useEffect Race Condition**: Added an active-flag pattern to App.tsx effects to prevent listener leaks on unmount, and guarded against storing `undefined` language in localStorage (#2827).

### Removed

- **LionCC Sponsor and Presets**: Removed the LionCC sponsor entry and LionCCAPI presets across READMEs, provider configs, and locales (icon asset retained).
- **AICoding Partner Entry**: Removed the AICoding partner from README sponsor listings, provider presets, and i18n metadata.
- **Kimi For Coding Codex Preset**: Removed the Kimi For Coding preset from the Codex preset catalog.
- **CLI Uninstall Command Hints**: Dropped generated CLI uninstall command hints from the tool-management UI while keeping conflict diagnostics visible.

### Docs

- **Codex Chat Provider Support**: Documented Chat Completions routing, provider support, reasoning auto-detection, and Local Routing guidance in the changelog and user manual.
- **Settings Manual Refresh**: Updated settings documentation for the new managed tool lifecycle and Hermes installer behavior.
- **Claude Desktop Guide**: Added localized Claude Desktop guide pages and screenshots for provider setup, import, model mapping, and Local Routing context.
- **Installation Docs**: Updated installation docs and READMEs to recommend the official Homebrew cask and refreshed the v3.15.0 release-note imposter-site warning wording across locales.

## [3.15.0] - 2026-05-16

Development since v3.14.1 focuses on a dedicated Claude Desktop surface with third-party provider switching through a proxy gateway, a large reverse-proxy hardening pass (reliability, retries, cache, takeover, Gemini/Vertex/Codex paths), expansion of the third-party provider preset catalog (BytePlus / Volcengine / ClaudeAPI / ClaudeCN / RunAPI / RelaxyCode / PatewayAI / Baidu Qianfan), role-based model mapping with a 1M context flag, Codex OAuth live model discovery, and a long tail of usage, OAuth, Codex, and session quality-of-life fixes.

**Stats**: 127 commits | 211 files changed | +17,980 insertions | -2,748 deletions

### Highlights

- **Claude Desktop becomes a first-class managed surface** with third-party provider switching through an in-app proxy gateway, role-based model mapping (sonnet / opus / haiku) with a 1M context flag, Copilot/Codex OAuth provider reuse, and 44 imported provider presets translated from the Claude Code catalog. Note: 20 Claude Desktop presets now default to direct mode instead of routing through the proxy — verify connectivity if you previously relied on proxy routing for these presets.
- **Major reverse-proxy hardening**: P0–P3 lifecycle, retry, failover, and rectifier patches; pooled HTTPS reuse for non-Anthropic backends; Codex/Responses cache hit-rate improvements; correct Anthropic ↔ OpenAI `tool_choice` mapping; Vertex AI URL preservation; Gemini path-based model extraction; takeover detection refinement; IPv6 listen address support.
- **Provider Ecosystem Expansion**: Added BytePlus, Volcengine Agentplan, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, RelaxyCode, PatewayAI, and Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan partner presets; promoted DouBao Seed to partner status; routing-support badges now surface on provider cards.
- **Role-Based Model Mapping for Claude Code**: Display-name-aware sonnet / opus / haiku route mapping with a `supports1m` flag replaces the legacy `[1M]` suffix and decouples routing from raw model IDs.
- **Codex OAuth Live Model Discovery**: ChatGPT Codex providers now fetch the live model list from the ChatGPT backend on demand instead of relying on a static list.
- **Usage Dashboard Filter-Driven Hero**: A new filter-driven Hero card with cache-normalized totals replaces the legacy summary block, paired with cache-cost-semantics fixes that silence a noisy pricing warning storm.
- **DeepSeek tool-call reasoning and zero-usage final deltas**: DeepSeek tool calls now return `reasoning_content` alongside `tool_calls` (#2543), and the final `message_delta` event always includes a usage block (even when zero) so strict Anthropic clients no longer crash on `null` (#2485).

### Added

- **Claude Desktop Third-Party Provider Switching via Proxy Gateway**: Added a dedicated Claude Desktop surface that brokers third-party Claude providers through CC Switch's in-app proxy, with a routing-support badge for providers that need it, role-based model route mapping locked to `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`, Copilot/Codex OAuth provider reuse, a redesigned Claude Code import flow, app-switcher differentiation between "Claude Code" and "Claude Desktop", and 44 provider presets translated from the Claude Code catalog.
- **Routing Support Badges on Provider Cards**: Provider cards in both Claude Code and Codex panels now show a routing-support badge so users can tell at a glance which providers can be served through Local Routing.
- **Codex OAuth Live Model List**: ChatGPT Codex providers now fetch the current model list from the ChatGPT backend on demand, replacing the previously hardcoded selection.
- **Role-Based Model Mapping with 1M Flag**: Claude Code model mapping is now role-based (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`) with display names and a `supports1m` flag, replacing the legacy `[1M]` suffix to decouple routing from raw model IDs.
- **Filter-Driven Usage Hero**: The usage dashboard's Hero summary is now filter-driven with cache-normalized totals so the figures line up with the active date range and provider filters.
- **Provider Form "Save Anyway" Prompt**: Softened provider form validation with a "save anyway" prompt so non-blocking input issues no longer prevent saving (#2307).
- **Universal Provider Duplicate Action**: Added a duplicate action for universal providers from the provider list (#2416).
- **Persisted Tauri Window State**: Window position and size now persist across launches (#2377).
- **Tray Icon Tooltip**: The system tray icon now shows a tooltip on hover for clearer at-a-glance state (#2417).
- **Warp Terminal Session Launch**: Added support for launching Warp and executing a saved session inside it (#2466).
- **DeepSeek `reasoning_content` for Tool Calls**: DeepSeek tool-calling responses now return `reasoning_content` together with `tool_calls` so callers can render both (#2543).
- **Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan for Claude Code**: Added a Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan preset for Claude Code (#2322).
- **Compshare Coding Plan Preset (Cross-App)**: Added Compshare Coding Plan preset across claude / codex / hermes / openclaw.
- **Partner Provider Presets**: Added BytePlus, Volcengine Agentplan, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, RelaxyCode, and PatewayAI provider presets; promoted DouBao Seed to partner status with refreshed endpoint and links.
- **44 Claude Desktop Provider Presets**: Translated 44 provider presets from the Claude Code catalog into the new Claude Desktop surface.

### Changed

- **20 Claude Desktop Presets Switched from Proxy to Direct Mode**: 20 Claude Desktop presets now ship in direct mode instead of routing through the proxy by default, reducing setup friction for users who don't need proxy-specific compatibility shims. Verify connectivity if you previously relied on proxy routing for these presets.
- **Claude Desktop Operational Notes**: Switching a Claude Desktop provider now writes CC Switch's managed 3P profile and requires restarting Claude Desktop to take effect; proxy-mode providers require CC Switch Local Routing to stay running.
- **Failover / Local Routing Guardrails**: Failover controls now require the target app's Local Routing takeover to be enabled, and stopping only the proxy service is blocked while any app still depends on takeover state.
- **Usage Accounting Semantics**: Usage summaries now report cache-normalized real total tokens and cache hit rate; historical token and cost totals may shift after deduplication and pricing recalculation, but should be more accurate.
- **Provider Preset Rendering Order**: Provider preset lists now render in author-defined array order with partners prioritized at the top, replacing the previous implicit sort.
- **Model Mapping Hint Copy Simplified**: `modelMappingOffHint` was rewritten as action-oriented copy across zh / en / ja.
- **CC Switch Brand Surface Unified to ccswitch.io**: All in-app and README references now point at ccswitch.io as the sole official website; the release notes template also surfaces ccswitch.io.
- **Theme Switch Simplified**: Removed the circular reveal animation; theme changes are now an instant cross-fade.
- **Claude Code App Switcher Differentiation**: The app switcher now visually distinguishes "Claude Code" from "Claude Desktop" and uses the "Claude Code" label in the app visibility settings.
- **CI: Claude Review on Opus 4.7**: Upgraded the Claude review GitHub Action to Opus 4.7, tuned the prompt to reduce nitpick noise, added an `@claude` review-only Code Action, pinned PR head SHA for checkout, and dropped a `--max-turns 5` limit.
- **Dependency Bumps**: `actions/checkout` 4 → 6 (#2517), `pnpm/action-setup` 5 → 6 (#2518), `softprops/action-gh-release` 2 → 3 (#2519), `actions/stale` 9 → 10 (#2520).
- **DeepSeek Presets Switched to V4**: DeepSeek presets now ship V4 (flash / pro) with refreshed pricing seeds.
- **Codex 1M Context Toggle Hidden in Provider Edit Form**: The 1M context-window toggle is no longer surfaced in the Codex provider edit form to reduce knob count for a setting that has no effect in current Codex deployments.
- **OpenClaudeCode Migrated to MicuAPI Domain**: Updated the OpenClaudeCode preset to the MicuAPI domain; refreshed Micu API links to `micuapi.ai`.
- **CrazyRouter Endpoints Switched to `cn` Subdomain**: Updated CrazyRouter preset endpoints to the `cn` subdomain.
- **RelaxyCode Custom Icon**: Switched RelaxyCode preset icon to a custom `relaxcode.png` asset.
- **Kimi For Coding Doc URL**: Updated Kimi For Coding website URL to the `/code/docs/` path.
- **SiliconFlow International Site Shows USD**: Balance display now correctly shows USD for the SiliconFlow international site (was incorrectly displaying CNY).

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Responses API Usage Parsing Robustness**: Hardened `build_anthropic_usage_from_responses()` and the Responses → Anthropic SSE translator so a missing or malformed upstream `usage` no longer produces `"usage": null` in `message_delta`. This unblocks strict Anthropic clients (notably the VSCode Claude Code extension) that crashed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'output_tokens')" against providers such as Codex OAuth and DashScope's `compatible-mode/v1/responses` endpoint. Added OpenAI field-name fallbacks (`prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens`), null/empty/partial object handling, and preserved cache token fields even when input/output tokens are missing (#2422).
- **Proxy Reliability Patches (P0–P3)**: Multiple rounds of routing, lifecycle, retry, and rectifier patches across the request-forwarder paths; extracted a shared `handle_rectifier_retry_failure` helper and a shared `auth_header_value` helper across provider adapters.
- **Proxy: Pooled HTTPS Connection Reuse**: Non-Anthropic backends now reuse pooled HTTPS connections instead of opening a fresh TLS session per request, materially reducing per-request latency.
- **Proxy: Forward Client HTTP Method**: The proxy forwards the client's actual HTTP method instead of hard-coding `POST`, so non-POST upstream endpoints (e.g. GET `/v1/models`) work correctly.
- **Proxy: Per-Attempt Counters and `max_retries` Wiring**: Client-request counters moved out of the per-attempt loop, and `AppProxyConfig.max_retries` is now correctly wired into the request forwarder.
- **Proxy: Failover Decision Refinements**: Refined failover decision logic in the forwarder so retryable / unretryable errors are classified more accurately.
- **Proxy: Takeover Detection Tightening**: Tightened takeover detection and use fallback restore when disabling takeover so leftover state no longer strands a provider.
- **Proxy: Anthropic ↔ OpenAI `tool_choice` Mapping**: Anthropic `tool_choice` is now correctly mapped to the OpenAI Chat nested form during format conversion.
- **Proxy: Gemini Request Model Extraction**: Gemini request model is now correctly extracted from the URI path (not the body) so transformed traffic reports the right model.
- **Proxy: Auth Header Error Handling**: `get_auth_headers` now returns `Result` instead of panicking on bad credentials.
- **Proxy: IPv6 Listen Address Validation**: The Proxy panel now accepts IPv6 listen addresses.
- **Proxy: Codex / Responses Cache Hit Rate**: Improved cache hit rate for Codex and OpenAI Responses requests by stabilizing cache key derivation; only emit `prompt_cache_key` when a real client-provided session identity is available so unrelated conversations no longer collapse onto a single key; canonicalize (sort) JSON keys in outgoing request bodies and `tool_call` arguments / `tool_result` content for byte-identical prefix-cache reuse; thread `session_id` into the usage logger for request correlation.
- **Proxy: JSON Schema Underscore Fields Preserved**: Private-parameter filtering now preserves underscore-prefixed field names inside JSON Schema name maps such as `properties`, `patternProperties`, `definitions`, and `$defs`, so user-defined schema keys like `_id` and `_meta` survive the filter.
- **Proxy: Read Tool Empty Pages**: Drop empty pages from `Read` tool inputs so providers don't reject the request (#2472).
- **Proxy: Per-Request Hot-Path Trim**: Trimmed per-request hot-path work and database wait time.
- **Proxy: Real Provider Model Names Under Takeover**: The Claude Code menu now exposes the real provider model names when running under takeover, instead of a stale alias.
- **Proxy: Zero Usage in Final Message Delta**: The final `message_delta` event always includes a usage block (even when zero) so strict Anthropic clients no longer crash on `null` (#2485).
- **Proxy: Streaming `message_delta` Deduplication**: Deduplicated streaming `message_delta` events that some upstreams emit twice (#2366).
- **Proxy: Scoped `reasoning_content` Preserved for Tool Calls**: Tool-call paths now correctly preserve the scoped `reasoning_content` field during transformation; Kimi / Moonshot OpenAI Chat compatibility paths keep the field while generic OpenAI-compatible requests stay free of it (#2367).
- **Proxy: Vertex AI Full URL Preserved**: Full Vertex AI URLs are no longer truncated during proxy forwarding (#2415).
- **Proxy: Leading Billing Header Stripped from System Content**: Strips the leading billing-header content that some upstreams prepend to the system message (#2350).
- **Proxy: Claude Auth Strategy from `ANTHROPIC_*` Env Var**: The Claude auth strategy is now derived from the actual `ANTHROPIC_*` env variable name rather than an opaque heuristic.
- **Third-Party Claude Providers: Disable Model Test**: Model probing is now disabled for third-party Claude providers where the gateway doesn't implement `/v1/models` consistently.
- **Model-Fetch: `/models` Subpath for Anthropic-Compatible Providers**: `/models` discovery now works for Anthropic-compatible subpath providers.
- **Copilot: Claude Model ID Resolution Against Live `/models`**: Copilot-backed providers now resolve Claude model IDs against the live `/models` list to avoid stale ID mismatches.
- **Codex: Skip `environment_context` Injection When Extracting Session Title**: Session title extraction no longer pulls in `environment_context` noise (#2439).
- **Codex: Hide Subagent Sessions**: Codex subagent sessions are now hidden from the main session list (#2445).
- **Codex Startup Live Import Duplication**: Fixed a duplicate-import bug in the Codex startup live-import path (#2590).
- **Codex Provider Switch History Drift**: Switching the active Codex provider no longer changes existing session history (#2349).
- **Codex Usage Log Message**: Corrected a misleading log message for Codex session usage (#2473).
- **Claude: Persist Max Effort via Env**: `max` effort now correctly persists via the env variable on restart (#2493).
- **Claude Desktop: Match Proxy Model Route Without `[1M]` Suffix**: Route matching no longer requires the legacy `[1M]` suffix.
- **Claude Desktop: Provider Form Focus Loss**: Fixed an input that lost focus while editing in the Claude Desktop provider form.
- **Claude Desktop: Spurious Proxy-Stopped Status Alert**: Removed an alert that fired spuriously when the proxy was intentionally stopped.
- **Claude Desktop: Empty Toolbar Capsule Hidden**: Hides the empty toolbar capsule when Claude Desktop is the active app.
- **UI: Monitor Badge Icon Centering**: Centered the Monitor badge icon in the app switcher.
- **Linux: Theme Selection Segfault**: Prevented selecting a theme from causing a segfault on Linux (#2502).
- **Terminal: iTerm Fallback on Cold Launch**: Prevented iTerm from being selected as a fallback on cold launch when not actually present (#2448).
- **Config: Sort JSON Keys Alphabetically**: Config writes now sort JSON keys alphabetically for deterministic output (#2469).
- **Import Existing Side-Effect Free**: Made "import existing" side-effect free (#2429).
- **Coding Plan: Zhipu Weekly Tier by Reset Time**: Corrected the Zhipu weekly tier name to match the actual reset time (#2420).
- **DashScope: Usage Parsing Robustness**: Hardened DashScope usage parsing so a malformed payload no longer crashes the VSCode Claude Code extension (#2425).
- **Usage: Prevent Double-Counting Between Proxy and Session-Log Sources**: Deduplicated usage records sourced from both the proxy and session logs.
- **Usage: Cache Cost Semantics + Pricing Warn Storm**: Corrected cache-cost semantics and silenced a noisy pricing warning storm that fired on every request.
- **CI: Frontend Formatting and Linux Clippy Restored**: Restored frontend formatting and Linux clippy checks in CI.
- **Proxy Test Helper Clippy Warning**: Fixed a clippy warning in the proxy test helper.

### Removed

- **Hermes Agent Usage Tracking Integration**: Removed the in-cycle Hermes Agent usage tracking integration after upstream behavior changes made it impractical to keep in sync. The integration was never enabled in any released version — a zero-cost rendering bug found during its development was fixed before the integration was rolled back.
- **Theme Switch Circular Reveal Animation**: Removed the circular reveal animation used during theme switching; the animation caused jank on slower compositors and added little visible value.
- **DDSHub Partner Integration**: Removed DDSHub as a partner preset and dropped the cross-link blurbs across READMEs.

### Docs

- **README Sponsor Refresh (zh / en / ja)**: Added BytePlus, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, and PatewayAI sponsor entries; cross-linked BytePlus and Volcengine entries; refreshed the Crazyrouter $2 credit claim flow, the Compshare blurb, the Right Code blurb, and other sponsor logos and listings; flattened the LionCC logo onto a white background; switched the Chinese README's sponsor logo to the Volcengine artwork; added Hermes Agent to the README subtitles.
- **Release Notes Template**: Surfaces `ccswitch.io` in the release notes template.
- **Brand Surface**: Documented `ccswitch.io` as the sole official website across READMEs and in-app references.

## [3.14.1] - 2026-04-23

Development since v3.14.0 focuses on Codex OAuth stability, tray usage visibility, Skills import/install reliability, Gemini session restore paths, and simplifying Hermes configuration health handling.

**Stats**: 13 commits | 48 files changed | +1,883 insertions | -808 deletions

### Added

- **Tray Usage Visibility**: System tray submenus now show cached usage for the current Claude / Codex / Gemini provider, including subscription and script-based usage summaries with utilization color markers. Tray-triggered refreshes are throttled, limited to visible apps, and synchronized back into React Query so the main window and tray share fresh usage data (#2184).
- **Tray Coding-Plan Usage (Kimi / Zhipu / MiniMax)**: System tray now renders 5-hour + weekly window usage for Chinese coding-plan providers using the same `🟢 h12% w80%` two-window layout as official subscription badges (worst utilization drives the emoji). Creating a Claude provider whose `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` matches a known coding-plan host now auto-injects `meta.usage_script`, so the tray lights up without opening the Usage Script modal. Existing `usage_script` values are preserved on update.
- **Codex OAuth FAST Mode**: Added an explicit FAST mode toggle for Codex OAuth-backed Claude providers. When enabled, converted Responses requests send `service_tier="priority"` for lower latency; the toggle stays off by default to avoid unexpectedly increasing ChatGPT quota consumption (#2210).

### Changed

- **Session and Settings Layout Polish**: Hardened the scroll-area viewport with width containment to fix horizontal overflow, and tightened app bottom spacing plus settings footer spacing so long session/settings views fit more cleanly (#2201).

### Removed

- **Hermes Config Health Scanner**: Removed the in-app Hermes config health scanner, warning banner, `scan_hermes_config_health` command, `HermesHealthWarning` type, and `HermesWriteOutcome.warnings` payload. CC Switch now keeps the Hermes surface focused on active provider display, provider switching defaults, memory editing, and launching the Hermes Web UI for deep configuration.

### Fixed

- **Codex OAuth Cache Routing**: Stabilized ChatGPT Codex reverse-proxy cache identity by using client-provided session IDs for `prompt_cache_key` and Codex session headers, preserving explicit cache keys, and avoiding generated UUID cache churn (#2218).
- **Codex OAuth Responses SSE Aggregation**: Non-streaming Anthropic clients now receive JSON even when the ChatGPT Codex upstream forces OpenAI Responses SSE; CC Switch aggregates the upstream SSE events before running the non-streaming transform (#2235).
- **Codex OAuth Stream Check Parity**: Stream checks now build Codex OAuth test requests with the same `store: false`, encrypted reasoning include, and provider FAST mode setting as production proxy requests (#2210).
- **Codex Model Extraction**: Replaced first-line regex matching with TOML parsing when reading Codex config models, so multiline TOML is handled correctly (#2227).
- **Model Quick-Set / One-Click Config**: Model quick-set updates now apply against the latest provider form config, preventing stale state from making one-click configuration fail (#2249).
- **Skills Import Duplicates**: The Skills import dialog disables actions while import is pending and the installed-skills cache deduplicates imported results by ID, preventing double-clicks from adding duplicate installed entries (#2139, #2211).
- **Root-Level Skill Repos**: Skill install and update flows now consistently resolve three source patterns: direct nested paths, install-name recursive search, and repository-root `SKILL.md` sources (#2231).
- **Gemini Session Restore Paths**: Gemini session scanning now reads `.project_root` metadata so restore flows can pass the original project directory when available (#2240).
- **Provider Hover Names**: Provider icons now expose the provider name on hover for inline SVG, image URL, and fallback initials render paths (#2237).

## [3.14.0] - 2026-04-21

Development since v3.13.0 focuses on onboarding Hermes Agent as a first-class managed app, rolling out Claude Opus 4.7 across the preset matrix, adding a Gemini Native API proxy, and sharpening session, usage, and proxy workflows.

**Stats**: 100 commits | 219 files changed | +20,548 insertions | -3,569 deletions

### Added

- **Hermes Agent Support (6th Managed App)**: Added Hermes Agent as a first-class managed app with database migration v9→v10, full Rust command surface, YAML-backed `~/.hermes/config.yaml` read/write with atomic backups, MCP sync, Skills sync, session manager with SQLite + JSONL support, and dedicated frontend panels. Supports four API protocols (`chat_completions`, `anthropic_messages`, `codex_responses`, `bedrock_converse`) aligned with Hermes Agent 0.10.0 schema. Read-only rendering for providers owned by the user-authored `providers:` dict, with deep configuration delegated to the Hermes Web UI.
- **Hermes Memory Panel**: Added a Memory panel for editing `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` directly from CC Switch, with an enable switch, character-count limits, and a live save flow. Replaces the Prompts entry for Hermes.
- **Hermes Provider Presets**: Added ~50 Hermes provider presets spanning Nous Research, Shengsuanyun, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Together AI, StepFun, Zhipu GLM, Bailian, Kimi, MiniMax, DouBao, BaiLing, ModelScope, KAT-Coder, PackyCode, Cubence, AIGoCode, RightCode, AICodeMirror, AICoding, CrazyRouter, SSSAiCode, Micu, CTok.ai, DDSHub, E-FlowCode, LionCCAPI, PIPELLM, Compshare, SiliconFlow, AiHubMix, DMXAPI, TheRouter, Novita, Nvidia, and Xiaomi MiMo.
- **Claude Opus 4.7 Support**: Added Claude Opus 4.7 with adaptive thinking whitelisting, per-million pricing seed, and Bedrock SKU (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` / `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`, dropping the legacy `-v1` suffix). Migrated all aggregator and Bedrock presets to Opus 4.7 as the default Opus model.
- **Claude `max` Effort Tier**: Upgraded the Claude effort dropdown from `high` to `max` for extended reasoning capacity.
- **Gemini Native API Proxy**: Added `api_format = "gemini_native"` so the proxy can forward to Google's `generateContent` API with full streaming, schema conversion, and shadow request support. Adds `gemini_url.rs`, `gemini_schema.rs`, `gemini_shadow.rs`, `streaming_gemini.rs`, and `transform_gemini.rs` under the proxy providers module.
- **GitHub Copilot Enterprise Server**: Added GHES authentication and endpoint configuration for Copilot-backed Claude providers, plus thinking-block stripping before upstream to preserve premium interaction quota.
- **Session List Virtualization**: Virtualized the session list via `@tanstack/react-virtual` so long conversations (thousands of records) scroll smoothly; long session messages are now collapsed by default to reduce text layout cost.
- **Codex / OpenClaw Session Title Extraction**: Added meaningful title auto-extraction for Codex and OpenClaw sessions with 2-line display; strips OpenClaw `message_id` suffix noise.
- **Usage Date Range Picker**: Added a date range selector to the usage dashboard with preset tabs (Today / 1d / 7d / 14d / 30d), a custom date + time calendar picker, and a page-jump input on paginated lists.
- **Model Mapping Quick-Set**: Added a quick-set button next to model mapping fields in provider forms for faster edits.
- **Stream Check Error Classification**: Classified Stream Check errors and surfaced them as color-coded toasts; refreshed default probe models and added explicit detection for "model not found" responses.
- **Block Official Provider Switching During Local Routing**: Blocks switching to official providers while Local Routing is active, since routing official API traffic through the local proxy carries account-suspension risk. A warning toast surfaces the block.
- **Pricing Database Refresh (v8 → v9)**: Added ~50 new model pricing entries and corrected stale prices via a reseed-on-migration step, including Claude 4.7, Opus 4.7 Adaptive Thinking, Grok 4, Qwen 3.5/3.6, MiniMax M2.5/M2.7, Doubao Seed 2.0 series, and GLM-5/5.1. DeepSeek and Kimi K2.5 prices updated.
- **Application-Level Window Controls**: Added an opt-in setting to render CC Switch's own minimize / toggle-maximize / close buttons instead of the system decorations, materially improving the experience on Linux Wayland where compositor-drawn buttons can become inert.
- **Hermes in Unified Skills Management**: Added Hermes to the unified Skills surface; skill install, enable, and filter now cover the Hermes app alongside Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / OpenClaw.
- **OpenClaw Config Directory Override**: Added a settings option to point CC Switch at a custom `openclaw.json` location.
- **Hermes Config Directory Override**: Added a settings option to point CC Switch at a custom `~/.hermes/config.yaml` location, backed by data-driven dispatch.
- **StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added StepFun Step Plan (EN/ZH) provider presets.
- **New API Usage Script Template**: Added a User-Agent header to the New API usage script template for better upstream compatibility.
- **Launch Hermes Dashboard from Toolbar**: When the Hermes Web UI probe fails, the toolbar entry now offers to run `hermes dashboard` in the user's preferred terminal via a temp bash/batch script. `hermes dashboard` opens the browser itself once ready, so no polling is required. Also corrects the stale `hermes web` hint in the offline toast (the real command is `hermes dashboard`) and reorders Linux terminal detection to try `which` before stat'ing `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`.
- **LemonData Provider Preset (All Six Apps)**: Registered LemonData as a third-party partner preset across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, with icon assets and zh/en/ja partner-promotion copy. Claude uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auth; OpenAI-compatible apps target `gpt-5.4`.
- **DDSHub Codex Preset**: Added a Codex-compatible endpoint for DDSHub at the same host as its Claude service; base URL omits the `/v1` suffix because the gateway auto-routes OpenAI SDK paths.

### Changed

- **"Local Proxy Takeover" → "Local Routing"**: Unified terminology across UI copy, README, and docs in all three locales. Functional behavior is unchanged.
- **Hermes `Auto` api_mode Removed**: Users must now pick an explicit protocol; new deeplinks default to `chat_completions`. Eliminates URL-based heuristic surprises.
- **Hermes Provider Form**: Added an API mode dropdown and per-provider model editor; bound per-provider models to the top-level `model:` when switching active providers.
- **Hermes Deep Config Delegation**: Deep YAML knobs are now delegated to the Hermes Web UI via a direct launch action, rather than duplicated in the CC Switch form.
- **`ANTHROPIC_REASONING_MODEL` Removed from Claude Quick-Set**: Decoupled the reasoning capability from model selection; the legacy field is no longer surfaced in the quick-set form.
- **Per-Provider Proxy Config Removed**: Consolidated into global Local Routing; the provider-level proxy toggle and associated storage are gone.
- **Unified Toolbar Icon Button Width**: Normalized icon-button widths across Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / OpenClaw / Hermes panels for a consistent header look.
- **Rust Toolchain Pinned to 1.95**: Adopted clippy 1.95 suggestions across the workspace and pinned the toolchain to prevent nightly drift.
- **Tray Menu ID Constant**: The tray identifier moved from the hardcoded string `"main"` to a `TRAY_ID` constant (`"cc-switch"`) across all call sites.
- **Copilot Request Classification**: Refined request routing inside the Copilot optimizer to further reduce unnecessary premium interaction consumption.
- **Usage Script Intranet Support**: Removed private-IP / suspicious-hostname blocking from usage scripts, unblocking enterprise intranet, Docker, and self-hosted API endpoints. Built-in templates still enforce HTTPS (except localhost) and same-origin checks; custom templates remain user-controlled with those request-URL checks skipped.
- **Failover Queue Notes**: Provider notes now appear in failover queue selectors and queue rows for easier identification across multi-provider queues.
- **Hermes Toolbar Layout**: Swapped the Hermes Web UI button from `ExternalLink` to `LayoutDashboard` (clicking may spawn `hermes dashboard` rather than just opening a URL), and moved MCP to the final toolbar slot so Hermes matches the Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode layout.

### Fixed

- **Header Auto-Compact Latching After Maximize**: The toolbar no longer stays compacted after maximize/restore; compaction now reevaluates on size changes.
- **Hermes YAML Pollution & OAuth MCP Auth Drop**: Round-tripping through CC Switch no longer drops OAuth MCP `auth` blocks or pollutes unrelated YAML keys; guard tests added via `tests/hermes_roundtrip.rs`.
- **Hermes Active Provider Display**: Hermes UI now correctly surfaces the active provider and wires add / enable / remove actions.
- **Hermes Provider Persistence**: Providers persist under `custom_providers:` so `api_mode` and `model` survive restarts and config reloads.
- **Codex `cache_control` Preservation**: Preserve `cache_control` when merging system prompts during Codex format conversion (#1946).
- **Claude Prompt Cache Key Leak**: Stopped sending prompt cache keys during Claude chat conversions (#2003).
- **Proxy Hop-by-Hop Header Stripping**: Strip hop-by-hop response headers (Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, etc.) per RFC 7230.
- **Permissive Proxy CORS Removed**: Removed the permissive CORS layer from the proxy (#1915).
- **Copilot Premium Consumption**: Further reduced unnecessary Copilot premium interaction consumption during pass-through traffic.
- **Backend Error Details in Proxy Toast**: Surface backend error payload details in proxy-related toast messages instead of a generic failure string.
- **Usage Log Deduplication**: Deduplicated proxy and session-log usage records so the same request is no longer double-counted; synced the request log time range with the dashboard's 1d / 7d / 30d selector.
- **Common Config Checkbox Persistence**: Checkbox state for Claude / Codex / Gemini common-config toggles now persists correctly across reopens.
- **Claude Plugin `settings.json` Sync**: Editing the current provider now syncs back to `settings.json` for the Claude plugin path.
- **Google Official Gemini Env Preservation**: Saving the Google Official Gemini provider no longer clobbers the `env` block.
- **OpenCode JSON5 Parser for Trailing Commas**: OpenCode config reads now tolerate trailing commas via a JSON5 parser.
- **Preset Refreshes**: Refreshed stale context windows for DeepSeek and Claude 1M; refreshed stale model IDs; backfilled Hermes model lists; fixed the Nous endpoint and replaced the Hermes placeholder icon with Nous brand artwork; pruned unused official Hermes presets.
- **Auto-Expand Collapsed Messages on Search Hit**: Collapsed messages now auto-expand when a search match lands inside hidden content.
- **Unknown Subscription Quota Tiers Hidden**: Provider cards no longer render unknown subscription quota tiers.
- **Weekly Limit Label Unified**: Aligned the weekly_limit tier label with the official 7-day naming across locales.
- **Root-Level Skill Repo Install**: Fixed skill installation when the repository root itself is a skill.
- **Session ID Parsing Clippy**: Removed a redundant closure in session ID parsing (clippy warning).
- **Usage Log Stat Dedup**: Deduplicated proxy-sourced and session-log-sourced usage records for accurate totals.
- **Stream Check Default Models Refresh**: Updated stream-check default probe models to match each vendor's current lineup.
- **Skills Import Sync**: Imported Skills are now immediately synced into enabled app directories instead of only being recorded in the database, so the UI no longer shows "installed" while the target app directory is missing the skill.
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Ghostty session restore launch by using shell execution with `--working-directory`, avoiding `cwd` escaping issues when the path contains spaces or special characters.
- **Hermes Health Check Borrowing OpenClaw Schema**: Hermes providers were routed through `check_additive_app_stream` (the OpenClaw dispatcher), which reads camelCase `baseUrl` / `apiKey` / `api` and surfaced "OpenClaw provider is missing baseUrl" even when every Hermes field was filled. Introduced `check_hermes_stream` with Hermes-specific extractors that map `api_mode` (`chat_completions` / `anthropic_messages` / `codex_responses`) to the matching `check_claude_stream` `api_format`, and returns `bedrock_converse` as unsupported. `api_mode` is now resolved before URL / API key extraction, so `bedrock_converse` users see the real cause rather than a misleading "missing base_url".
- **Usage Query Modal for Hermes & OpenClaw**: `getProviderCredentials` now reads flat `settingsConfig` fields for Hermes (snake_case `base_url` / `api_key`) and OpenClaw (camelCase `baseUrl` / `apiKey`), so the "official balance" template auto-selects for matching providers like SiliconFlow. Also refactored the BALANCE and TOKEN_PLAN test paths to reuse the precomputed `providerCredentials` instead of re-reading `env.ANTHROPIC_*` directly, fixing the "empty key" error for non-Claude apps even when the key was configured.

### Docs

- **README Sponsor Updates**: Updated SiliconFlow signup bonus to ¥16, trimmed the SSSAiCode sponsor blurb, updated partner logos, and added LemonData as a new sponsor.
- **Global Proxy Hint Clarified**: Clarified the global proxy hint about local routing across all three locales.
- **Takeover → Routing Rename**: Renamed takeover docs to routing and updated anchors across all languages.
- **PIPELLM Website URL**: Updated the PIPELLM sponsor website URL to `code.pipellm.ai`.

### Breaking

- **Hermes requires explicit `api_mode`**: The `Auto` mode is gone; imported or deeplinked providers default to `chat_completions`. Users with prior `Auto` configs will be prompted to pick a protocol.
- **`ANTHROPIC_REASONING_MODEL` removed from Claude quick-set**: The legacy field is no longer exposed; existing settings are cleaned up automatically.
- **Per-provider proxy configuration removed**: Migrate to the global Local Routing setting. Existing per-provider proxy values are ignored.
- **Database schema bumped v9 → v10**: Adds `enabled_hermes` columns to `mcp_servers` and `skills` (auto-migrated with `DEFAULT 0`; no data loss).
- **Pricing table reseeded (v8 → v9)**: The `model_pricing` table is cleared and reseeded on first launch to pick up new models and corrected prices.
- **XCodeAPI preset removed**: Users of the XCodeAPI preset should switch to another provider.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-04-10

Development since v3.12.3 focuses on quota visibility, provider workflow upgrades, stronger proxy compatibility, and lower-overhead tray / session workflows.

### Added

- **Lightweight Mode**: Added a tray-only mode that destroys the main window and keeps CC Switch running from the system tray, with the window recreated when users reopen it.
- **Provider Model Auto-Fetch**: Added OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` discovery for Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw provider forms, including grouped dropdown selection and failure-specific error messages.
- **Quota & Balance Visibility**: Added inline quota or balance display for official Claude / Codex / Gemini providers, GitHub Copilot premium interactions, Codex OAuth providers, Token Plan providers (Kimi / Zhipu GLM / MiniMax), and official balance queries for DeepSeek, StepFun, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, and Novita AI. Copilot / ChatGPT OAuth and CLI subscription quota now only auto-poll for the currently active provider, preventing unnecessary API calls and misleading displays on non-current cards.
- **Skills Discovery & Batch Updates**: Added SHA-256 based skill update detection, per-skill and batch update actions, a storage-location toggle between CC Switch and `~/.agents/skills`, and public `skills.sh` search integration.
- **Session Workflow Upgrades**: Added batch delete in Session Manager, a directory picker before launching Claude terminal restore commands, usage import from Claude / Codex / Gemini session logs without requiring proxy interception, and per-app usage filtering for Claude / Codex / Gemini dashboards.
- **Codex OAuth Reverse Proxy**: Added ChatGPT Plus / Pro based Codex OAuth reverse proxy support for Claude provider cards, including managed OAuth login and inline subscription quota display.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Coverage**: Added OpenCode npm package mapping plus support for OpenClaw `openai-completions` and the remaining OpenClaw protocol variants in Stream Check.
- **Full URL Endpoint Mode**: Added a provider option that treats `base_url` as a complete upstream endpoint so proxy forwarding and stream checks can work with vendors that require nonstandard URL layouts.
- **OpenCode StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added a StepFun Step Plan provider preset for OpenCode.
- **Copilot Interaction Optimizer**: Added request classification and routing logic to reduce unnecessary GitHub Copilot premium interaction consumption.
- **First-Run Welcome Dialog**: Added a one-time welcome dialog on fresh installs explaining how existing configuration is preserved as a default provider and how the bundled official preset enables one-click revert. Upgrade users are excluded.
- **Official Provider Seeding**: Added automatic seeding of Claude Official, OpenAI Official, and Google Official provider entries on startup, giving every user a one-click path back to the official endpoint.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Auto-Import**: Added automatic startup import of live OpenCode and OpenClaw provider configurations, matching the auto-import behavior already present for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.
- **Common Config Editor Guidance**: Added an informational guide and empty-state prompt to the Common Config snippet editor modal for Claude, Codex, and Gemini, with i18n support.
- **Common Config First-Run Notice**: Added a one-time informational dialog explaining Common Config Snippets when users first open the provider add/edit form.
- **Claude Session Titles**: Added meaningful title extraction for Claude sessions using a priority chain: custom-title metadata, first real user message, then directory basename fallback.
- **Session Search Highlighting**: Added keyword highlighting in session titles and messages during Session Manager search.
- **URL-Based Provider Icons**: Added a dual rendering mode to the icon system supporting Vite URL imports for large SVGs and raster images (PNG, JPG, WebP), keeping small SVGs inlined.
- **Kaku Terminal Support**: Added Kaku as a selectable terminal for session launch on macOS, reusing the WezTerm-compatible launch path.
- **OMO Slim Council Support**: Restored first-class council support as a built-in oh-my-opencode-slim agent with updated metadata and UI copy.
- **TheRouter Provider Preset**: Added TheRouter provider presets across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw.
- **DDSHub Provider Preset**: Added DDSHub as a third-party partner provider for Claude with icon and partner promotion text.
- **LionCCAPI Provider Preset**: Added LionCCAPI as a third-party partner provider across all five apps with anthropic-messages protocol for OpenCode and OpenClaw.
- **Shengsuanyun Provider Preset**: Added Shengsuanyun (胜算云) as an aggregator partner provider across all five apps with URL-based icon and localized display name.
- **PIPELLM Provider Preset**: Added PIPELLM provider preset across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and OpenClaw with full model definitions and icon.
- **E-FlowCode Provider Preset**: Added E-FlowCode provider preset across all five apps with per-app protocol configuration.

### Changed

- **Tray Menu Organization**: Reworked the tray menu into per-app submenus to prevent overflow and make background provider switching scale better with larger provider lists.
- **Proxy Forwarding Stack**: Refactored proxy forwarding onto a Hyper-based client with transparent header forwarding, improved endpoint rewriting, and better support for dynamic upstream endpoints.
- **OAuth Auth Center UI Polish**: Tightened the Auth Center copy, layout, and icon presentation so the Codex OAuth login flow feels cleaner and less cluttered.
- **Provider Key Lifecycle & Live Sync**: Reworked additive provider create / rename / duplicate flows so live config writes, cleanup, and rollback stay consistent across OpenCode / OpenClaw and takeover scenarios.
- **Codex OAuth Defaults**: Updated the Codex OAuth preset to the GPT-5.4 model family.

### Fixed

- **Copilot Authentication & Proxy Compatibility**: Fixed GitHub Copilot authentication regressions, corrected enterprise / dynamic endpoint handling, repaired clipboard verification-code copying on macOS and Linux, and fixed Responses routing when Copilot-backed Claude providers target OpenAI models.
- **Streaming Parser Compatibility**: Fixed SSE parsing to accept fields with optional spaces, improving compatibility with non-strict streaming implementations.
- **UTF-8 Stream Chunk Boundaries**: Fixed intermittent garbled output (U+FFFD replacement characters) in Claude Code when multi-byte UTF-8 sequences such as Chinese characters or emoji were split across TCP stream chunks via the Copilot reverse proxy, by preserving incomplete trailing bytes across chunks in all four SSE streaming paths instead of lossy decoding.
- **Fragmented System Prompt Normalization**: Fixed strict OpenAI-compatible chat backends (Nvidia, Qwen-style) rejecting requests when converted Claude payloads contained multiple system messages, by merging system content into a single leading system message during the Anthropic → OpenAI chat transformation.
- **Provider Switch State Corruption**: Serialized per-app provider switches to prevent concurrent failover or hot-switch operations from leaving `is_current`, settings state, and live backup state out of sync.
- **Claude Takeover Live Config Drift**: Fixed provider edits while Claude takeover is active so live settings remain aligned with the latest provider state without breaking takeover restore behavior.
- **WebDAV Password Retention & Validation**: Fixed the WebDAV password field so saved credentials remain visible after refresh and treated `MKCOL 405` responses correctly during connection validation.
- **Provider Card Action States**: Fixed additive-mode highlight behavior, aligned usage display layout across provider cards, replaced hard proxy-switch blocking with a warning path, and disabled unsupported test / usage actions for Copilot and Codex OAuth cards.
- **Usage Accuracy & Pricing**: Fixed MiniMax quota math and 0%→100% progression, corrected CNY→USD pricing plus missing model definitions, improved Gemini session-log syncing, and resolved session-based usage entries being shown as unknown providers.
- **Usage Editor & Skills UI Regressions**: Fixed usage query fields being reset while editing extractor code, corrected broken `skills.sh` links and empty descriptions, and fixed auto-query defaults plus number-input clearing in usage configuration.
- **Chinese Skills Terminology**: Unified Skills-related labels across settings panels in the `zh` locale so storage and sync options use consistent wording.
- **Environment & Preset Compatibility**: Added Bun global bin detection in CLI scan, adapted to the oh-my-openagent rename with backward compatibility, corrected the OpenCode `kimi-for-coding` preset, gated Gemini keychain parsing to macOS, and fixed an OpenClaw serializer panic on empty collections.
- **Linux UI Unresponsive on Startup**: Fixed a bug where the window UI (including native title bar buttons) couldn't receive clicks on Linux until the user manually maximized and restored the window. Root causes: (1) Tauri webview did not acquire keyboard focus after `show()` on Linux, so the first click was consumed by X11/Wayland click-to-activate (Tauri #10746, wry #637); (2) GTK surface's input region failed to renegotiate on the `visible:false → show()` path under some WebKitGTK/compositor combinations, leaving the entire window unresponsive. Mitigations: set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` at startup, and added a new `linux_fix::nudge_main_window` helper that performs `set_focus` + a ±1px no-op resize ~200ms after show, equivalent to a visually invisible "maximize-and-restore". Wired into all window-re-show paths (normal startup, deeplink, single_instance, tray `show_main`, lightweight exit).
- **Linux Drag Region on Header**: Removed `data-tauri-drag-region` from the top header bar on Linux to avoid triggering `gtk_window_begin_move_drag` paths affected by Tauri #13440 under Wayland. macOS drag behavior is preserved.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Edge Cases**: Fixed custom-header passthrough, OpenClaw custom auth-header detection, Bedrock error messaging, and OpenCode default `baseURL` fallback handling in Stream Check.
- **Duplicate Toast on Provider Switch**: Fixed double toast notifications (proxy-required warning followed by switch-success) when switching to Copilot, ChatGPT, or OpenAI-format providers with the proxy not running.
- **Session Search Accuracy & Chinese Support**: Fixed session search result truncation across providers and switched FlexSearch tokenizer to full mode for proper Chinese substring matching.
- **Adaptive Thinking Reasoning Effort**: Fixed `resolve_reasoning_effort()` mapping adaptive thinking to `xhigh` instead of incorrectly using `high` in OpenAI format conversions.
- **Thinking Model Fallback Display**: Fixed the Claude provider form showing an empty Thinking model field after saving only a main model by applying read-only fallback to ANTHROPIC_MODEL.
- **Auth Tab Localization**: Fixed missing i18n translation keys for the settings auth tab label across all locale bundles.
- **Schema Migration Guard**: Fixed database migrations failing when skills or model_pricing tables did not exist by adding table-existence checks before ALTER and UPDATE operations.

### Docs

- **User Manual Refresh**: Updated the EN / ZH / JA manuals for tray submenus, lightweight mode, provider model fetching, session management, workspace files, WebDAV v2 behavior, OpenCode / OpenClaw activation, and other provider workflow improvements.
- **Community & Contribution Docs**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, bilingual issue / PR templates, Dependabot config, and CI quality checks.
- **Release Notes Risk Notice**: Added a Copilot reverse proxy risk notice and anchored highlight links in the v3.12.3 release notes across all three languages.
- **Sponsor Partners**: Added Shengsuanyun, LionCC, and DDS as sponsor partners in README across all languages.

## [3.12.3] - 2026-03-24

Major release adding GitHub Copilot reverse proxy support, macOS code signing & Apple notarization, intelligent reasoning effort mapping for o-series models, skill backup/restore lifecycle, proxy gzip compression, and critical fixes for WebDAV password safety, tool message parsing, and dark mode.

**Stats**: 36 commits | 107 files changed | +9,124 insertions | -802 deletions

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot Reverse Proxy**: Full GitHub Copilot integration as a Claude Code provider via OAuth Device Code flow; includes multi-account management, automatic token refresh, Anthropic ↔ OpenAI format conversion, real-time model list fetching, and usage statistics (#930)
- **Copilot Auth Center**: New Auth Center panel in Settings for managing GitHub accounts globally, with per-provider account binding via `meta.authBinding`
- **Tool Search Toggle**: Added `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` env var support for Claude 2.1.76+; exposed as a checkbox in the provider Common Config editor (#930)
- **Reasoning Effort Mapping**: Two-tier `resolve_reasoning_effort()` for OpenAI o-series and GPT-5+ models — explicit `output_config.effort` takes priority, falling back to thinking `budget_tokens` thresholds (<4 000→low, 4 000–16 000→medium, ≥16 000→high); covers both Chat Completions and Responses API paths with 17 unit tests
- **OpenCode SQLite Backend**: Added SQLite session storage support for OpenCode alongside existing JSON backend; dual-backend scan with SQLite priority on ID conflicts, atomic session deletion, and path validation (#1401)
- **Skill Auto-Backup**: Skill files are automatically backed up to `~/.cc-switch/skill-backups/` before uninstall, with metadata preserved in `meta.json`; old backups pruned to keep at most 20
- **Skill Backup Restore & Delete**: Added list/restore/delete commands for skill backups; restore copies files back to SSOT, saves the DB record, and syncs to the current app with rollback on failure
- **macOS Code Signing & Notarization**: CI now imports an Apple Developer ID certificate, signs the universal binary, submits for Apple notarization, and staples the ticket to both `.app` and `.dmg`; a hard-fail verification step (`codesign --verify` + `spctl -a` + `stapler validate`) gates the release for both artifacts
- **Codex 1M Context Window Toggle**: One-click checkbox in Codex config editor to set `model_context_window = 1000000` with auto-populated `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900000`; unchecking removes both fields
- **Disable Auto-Upgrade Toggle**: Added `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` env var checkbox in the Claude Common Config editor to prevent Claude Code from auto-upgrading

### Changed

- **Skills Cache Strategy**: Replaced `invalidateQueries` with direct `setQueryData` updates for skill install/uninstall/import operations; added `staleTime: Infinity` with `keepPreviousData` to eliminate loading flicker (#1573)
- **Proxy Gzip Compression**: Non-streaming proxy requests now auto-negotiate gzip compression instead of forcing `identity`; streaming requests conservatively keep `identity` to avoid SSE decompression errors
- **o1/o3 Model Compatibility**: Chat Completions proxy forwarding now correctly uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` for OpenAI o-series models such as o1/o3/o4-mini (#1451)
- **OpenCode Model Variants**: Placed OpenCode model variants at top level instead of inside options for better discoverability (#1317)
- **Skills Import Flow**: Replaced implicit filesystem-based app inference with explicit `ImportSkillSelection` to prevent incorrect multi-app activation; added reconciliation to remove disabled/orphaned symlinks and MCP servers from live config
- **Claude 4.6 Context Window**: Updated Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 context window from 200K to 1M across OpenClaw and OpenCode presets (GA release)
- **MiniMax Model Upgrade**: Updated MiniMax presets from M2.5 to M2.7 across Claude, OpenClaw, and OpenCode configurations with updated partner descriptions in all three locales
- **Xiaomi MiMo Model Upgrade**: Updated MiMo presets from mimo-v2-flash to mimo-v2-pro across all supported applications
- **AddProviderDialog Simplification**: Removed redundant OAuth tab, reducing dialog from 3 tabs to 2 (app-specific + universal)
- **Provider Form Advanced Options Collapse**: Model mapping, API format, and other advanced fields in the Claude provider form now auto-collapse when empty; auto-expands when any value is set or when a preset fills them in

### Fixed

- **WebDAV Password Silent Clear**: Fixed WebDAV password being silently wiped when ProviderList or UsageScriptModal saved settings by stripping `webdavSync` from frontend payloads and adding backend backfill logic in `merge_settings_for_save()` to preserve existing passwords
- **Tool Message Parsing**: Fixed tool_use/tool_result message classification across Claude (tool_result content blocks), Codex (function_call/function_call_output payloads), and Gemini (array content + toolCalls extraction) session providers (#1401)
- **Dark Mode Selector**: Changed Tailwind `darkMode` from `["selector", "class"]` to `["selector", ".dark"]` to ensure correct dark mode activation (#1596)
- **Copilot Request Fingerprint**: Unified Copilot request fingerprint headers across all API call sites to prevent User-Agent leakage and stream check mismatches
- **o-series Responses API Tokens**: Kept Responses API on the correct `max_output_tokens` field for o-series models instead of incorrectly injecting `max_completion_tokens`
- **Provider Form Double Submit**: Prevented duplicate submissions on rapid button clicks in provider add/edit forms (#1352)
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Claude session restore in Ghostty terminal (#1506)
- **Skill ZIP Import Extension**: Added `.skill` file extension support in ZIP import dialog (#1240, #1455)
- **Skill ZIP Install Target App**: ZIP skill installs now use the currently active app instead of always defaulting to Claude
- **OpenClaw Active Card Highlight**: Fixed active OpenClaw provider card not being highlighted (#1419)
- **Responsive Layout with TOC**: Improved responsive design when TOC title exists (#1491)
- **Import Skills Dialog White Screen**: Added missing TooltipProvider in ImportSkillsDialog to prevent runtime crash when opening the dialog
- **Panel Bottom Blank Area**: Replaced hardcoded `h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]` with `flex-1 min-h-0` across all content panels to eliminate bottom gap caused by mismatched offset values

### Docs

- **Pricing Model ID Normalization**: Added documentation section explaining model ID normalization rules (prefix stripping, suffix trimming, `@`→`-` replacement) in EN/ZH/JA user manuals (#1591)
- **macOS Signed & Notarized**: Removed all `xattr` workaround instructions and "unidentified developer" warnings from README, README_ZH, installation guides (EN/ZH/JA), and FAQ pages (EN/ZH/JA); replaced with "signed and notarized by Apple" messaging

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-12

Post-v3.12.1 work focuses on Common Config safety during proxy takeover and more reliable Codex TOML editing.

**Stats**: 5 commits | 22 files changed | +1,716 insertions | -288 deletions

### Added

- **Empty State Guidance**: Improved first-run experience with detailed import instructions and a conditional Common Config snippet hint for Claude/Codex/Gemini providers

### Changed

- **Proxy Takeover Restore Flow**: Proxy takeover hot-switch and provider sync now refresh the restore backup instead of overwriting live config files, rebuilding effective provider settings with Common Config applied so rollback preserves the real user configuration
- **Codex TOML Editing Engine**: Refactored Codex `config.toml` updates onto shared section-aware TOML helpers in Rust and TypeScript, covering `base_url` and `model` field edits across provider forms and takeover cleanup
- **Common Config Initialization Lifecycle**: Startup now auto-extracts Common Config snippets from clean live configs before takeover restoration, tracks explicit "snippet cleared" state, and persists a one-time legacy migration flag to avoid repeated backfills

### Fixed

- **Common Config Loss During Takeover**: Fixed cases where proxy takeover could drop Common Config changes, overwrite live configs during sync, or produce incomplete restore snapshots when switching providers
- **Codex Restore Snapshot Preservation**: Fixed Codex takeover restore backups so existing `mcp_servers` blocks survive provider hot-switches instead of being discarded; changed MCP backup preservation from wholesale table replacement to per-server-id merge so provider/common-config MCP updates win on conflict while live-only servers are retained
- **Cleared Snippet Resurrection**: Fixed startup auto-extraction recreating Common Config snippets that users had intentionally cleared
- **Codex `base_url` Misplacement**: Fixed Codex `base_url` extraction and editing to target the active `[model_providers.<name>]` section instead of appending to the file tail or confusing `mcp_servers.*.base_url` entries for provider endpoints

## [3.11.1] - 2026-02-28

### Hotfix Release

This release reverts the Partial Key-Field Merging architecture introduced in v3.11.0, restoring the proven "full config overwrite + Common Config Snippet" mechanism, and fixes several UI and platform compatibility issues.

**Stats**: 8 commits | 52 files changed | +3,948 insertions | -1,411 deletions

### Reverted

- **Restore Full Config Overwrite + Common Config Snippet** (revert 992dda5c): Reverted the partial key-field merging refactoring from v3.11.0 due to critical issues — non-whitelisted custom fields were lost during provider switching, backfill permanently stripped non-key fields from the database, and the whitelist required constant maintenance. Restores full config snapshot write, Common Config Snippet UI and backend commands, and 6 frontend components/hooks

### Changed

- **Proxy Panel Layout**: Moved proxy on/off toggle from accordion header into panel content area, placed directly above app takeover options, ensuring users see takeover configuration immediately after enabling the proxy
- **Manual Import for OpenCode/OpenClaw**: Removed auto-import on startup; empty state now shows an "Import Current Config" button, consistent with Claude/Codex/Gemini behavior

### Fixed

- **"Follow System" Theme Not Auto-Updating**: Delegated to Tauri's native theme tracking (`set_window_theme(None)`) so the WebView's `prefers-color-scheme` media query stays in sync with OS theme changes
- **Compact Mode Cannot Exit**: Restored `flex-1` on `toolbarRef` so `useAutoCompact`'s exit condition triggers correctly based on available width instead of content width
- **Proxy Takeover Toast Shows {{app}}**: Added missing `app` interpolation parameter to i18next `t()` calls for proxy takeover enabled/disabled messages

### Changed

#### Architecture

- **Partial Key-Field Merging (⚠️ Breaking, reverted in v3.11.1)**: Provider switching now uses partial key-field merging instead of full config overwrite, preserving user's non-provider settings (plugins, MCP, permissions). The "Common Config Snippet" feature has been removed as it is no longer needed. Removes 6 frontend files and ~150 lines of backend dead code (#1098)
- **Manual Import**: Replaced auto-import on startup with manual “Import Current Config” button in empty state, reducing ~47 lines of startup code
- **OMO Variant Parameterization**: Eliminated ~250 lines of OMO/OMO Slim code duplication via `OmoVariant` struct with STANDARD/SLIM constants
- **OMO Common Config Removal**: Removed the two-layer merge system for OMO common config (-1,733 lines across 21 files)

#### Code Quality

- **ProviderForm Decomposition**: Extracted ProviderForm.tsx from 2,227 lines to 1,526 lines by splitting into 5 focused modules (opencodeFormUtils, useOmoModelSource, useOpencodeFormState, useOmoDraftState, useOpenclawFormState)
- **Shared MCP/Skills Components**: Extracted AppCountBar, AppToggleGroup, and ListItemRow shared components to eliminate duplication across MCP and Skills panels
- **OpenClaw TanStack Query Migration**: Migrated Env, Tools, and AgentsDefaults panels from manual useState/useEffect to centralized TanStack Query hooks

#### Settings Layout

- **Proxy Tab**: Split Advanced tab into dedicated Proxy tab (local proxy, failover, rectifiers, global outbound proxy); moved pricing config to Usage dashboard as collapsible accordion. SettingsPage reduced from ~716 to ~426 lines with 5-tab layout: General | Proxy | Advanced | Usage | About
- **Data Section Split**: Split data accordion into Import/Export and Cloud Sync sections for better discoverability

#### Terminal & Config

- **Unified Terminal Selection**: Consolidated terminal preference to global settings; added WezTerm support and terminal name mapping (iterm2 → iterm)
- **OpenClaw Agents Panel**: Primary model field set to read-only; detailed model fields (context window, max tokens, reasoning, cost) moved to advanced options
- **Claude Model Update**: Updated Claude model references from 4.5 to 4.6 across all provider presets

### Fixed

#### Critical

- **Windows Home Dir Regression**: Restored default home directory resolution on Windows to prevent providers/settings “disappearing” when `HOME` env var differs from the real user profile directory (Git/MSYS environments); auto-detects v3.10.3 legacy database location
- **Linux White Screen**: Disabled WebKitGTK hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs (Cezanne/Radeon Vega) to prevent EGL initialization failure causing blank screen on startup
- **OpenAI Beta Parameter**: Stopped appending `?beta=true` to OpenAI Chat Completions endpoints, fixing request failures for Nvidia and other `apiFormat=”openai_chat”` providers
- **Health Check Auth Mode**: Health check now respects provider's auth_mode setting instead of always using x-api-key header

#### Provider & Preset

- **OpenClaw /v1 Prefix**: Removed /v1 prefix from OpenClaw anthropic-messages presets to prevent double path (/v1/v1/messages) with Anthropic SDK auto-append
- **Opus Pricing**: Corrected Opus pricing from $15/$75 to $5/$25 and upgraded model ID to claude-opus-4-6
- **AIGoCode URLs**: Unified API base URL to https://api.aigocode.com across all apps; removed trailing /v1 suffix
- **Zhipu GLM**: Removed outdated partner status from Claude, OpenCode, and OpenClaw presets
- **API Key Visibility**: Restored API Key input field when creating new Claude providers (was incorrectly hidden for non-cloud_provider categories)

#### OMO / OMO Slim

- **OMO Slim Category Checks**: Added missing omo-slim category checks across add/form/mutation paths
- **OMO Slim Cache Invalidation**: Invalidate OMO Slim query cache after provider mutations to prevent stale UI state
- **OMO Recommended Models**: Synced agent/category recommended models with upstream sources; fixed provider/model format to pure model IDs
- **OMO Fill Feedback**: Added toast feedback when “Fill Recommended” button silently fails
- **OMO Last-Provider Restriction**: Removed last-provider deletion restriction for OMO/OMO Slim plugins
- **OpenCode Model Validation**: Reject saving OpenCode providers without at least one configured model

#### OpenClaw

- **OpenClaw P0-P3 Fixes**: Fixed 25 missing i18n keys, replaced key={index} with stable crypto.randomUUID(), excluded openclaw from ProxyToggle/FailoverToggle, added deep link merge_additive_config(), unified serde(flatten) naming, added directory existence checks, removed dead code, added duplicate key validation
- **OpenClaw Robustness**: Fixed EnvPanel visibleKeys using entry key names instead of array indices; added NaN guards; validated provider ID and model before import
- **OpenClaw i18n Dedup**: Merged duplicate openclaw i18n keys to restore provider form translations

#### Platform

- **Window Flash**: Prevented window flicker on silent startup (Windows)
- **Title Bar Theme**: Title bar now follows dark/light mode theme changes
- **Skills Path Separator**: Fixed path separator matching for skill installation status on Windows (supports both `/` and `\`)
- **WSL Conditional Compilation**: Added `#[cfg(target_os = “windows”)]` to WSL helper functions to eliminate dead_code warnings on non-Windows platforms

#### UI

- **Toolbar Clipping**: Removed toolbar height limit that was clipping AppSwitcher
- **Update Badge**: Show update badge instead of green check when a newer version is available
- **Session Button Visibility**: Only show Session Manager button for Claude and Codex apps
- **Directory Spacing**: Added vertical spacing between directory setting sections
- **Dark Mode Cards**: Unified SQL import/export card styling in dark mode
- **OpenClaw Scroll**: Enabled scrolling for OpenClaw configuration panel content

#### i18n & Localization

- **Session Manager i18n**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese strings with i18n keys for relative time, role labels, and UI elements
- **OpenClaw Default Model Label**: Renamed “Enable/Default” to “Set as Default / Current Default” with wider button
- **Daily Memory Sort**: Sort daily memory files by filename date (YYYY-MM-DD.md) instead of modification time
- **Backup Name i18n**: Use local time for backup file names

#### Other

- **Skill Doc URL**: Use actual branch from download_repo for documentation URL; switched from /tree/ to /blob/ pointing to SKILL.md
- **OpenCode Install Detection**: Added install.sh priority paths (OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR > XDG_BIN_DIR > ~/bin > ~/.opencode/bin) with path dedup and cross-platform executable candidates
- **Provider Auto-Import**: Removed auto-import side effect from useProvidersQuery queryFn; users now trigger import manually via empty state button
- **Manual Backup Validation**: Treat missing database file as error during manual backup to prevent false success toast

### Performance

- **Session Panel Loading**: Parallel directory scanning and head-tail JSONL reading for Codex, OpenClaw, and OpenCode session providers
- **Query Cache Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary TanStack Query cache overhead for Tauri local IPC calls

### Documentation

- **Sponsors**: Added/updated SSSAiCode, Crazyrouter, AICoding, Right Code, and MiniMax sponsor entries across all README languages
